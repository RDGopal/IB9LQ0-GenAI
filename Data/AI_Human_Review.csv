"This game is incredible, as everyone has said. The graphics and attention to detail and historical accuracy are top-notch. The only downside is that the PlayStation 3 version doesn't offer the same level of realism as the Xbox 360 version with the Ace-Edge joystick/throttle. If you have both consoles, I would highly recommend opting for the Xbox 360 version with the Ace-Edge for the best possible experience.

"Enter the Matrix is a game based off of The Matrix Reloaded movie, which some people were dissatisfied with. Despite some negative reviews from magazines, the game is still enjoyable. It has a lot of replay value with two different characters to play as, and the action is non-stop with driving cars and ships, shooting from turrets and cars, shooting with guns on the ground, and awesome fighting. The story line is also great for Matrix fans, as it fills in many gaps from The Matrix Reloaded. Although there are some technical issues such as it being short, graphical problems, and fustrating controls, it is still a great game for all action and Matrix fans.",enter matrix game based matrix reloaded movie people didnt like movie game still good game negative reviews magazines game enjoyable lot replay value two different characters play action nonstop driving cars ships shooting turrets cars shooting guns ground awesome fighting story line great matrix fans fills many gaps matrix reloaded game technical issues short graphical problems fustrating controls still great game action matrix fans

"I am giving this game 5 stars because it is really enjoyable to play and the graphics look great. The controls are precise and the cutscenes have been upgraded to a higher resolution than the God of War series. However, I had to stop playing after only an hour due to feeling nauseous, dizzy and like I had a concussion. Although there is a warning on the box, this has been the case with video games since the Atari days. The only other game that caused this reaction for me was Killzone 2, and according to reviews on the web, this happened to a lot of people who had never experienced these symptoms from video games before. I have suffered head injuries in the military that prevent me from going on rollercoasters, and this game left me feeling like I had been on one. It took two hours to make the symptoms go away.

"We are incredibly pleased with this Rocksmith 2014 Xbox package! My son has been learning to play electric guitar for the past three months and has seen considerable progress, but has made even more since he started to actually use it. We employed the most basic setup, which was a USB connection to the guitar from the Xbox. The game play looks similar to Guitar Hero, but since you use an actual guitar it teaches you the correct way to play. There are Practice (teaches basics), Play (teaches songs), and Session Modes (creates a band to play along with you) that offer a good amount of diversity, which makes it enjoyable. The selection of songs is quite varied and it was easy to find some that he likes. This is a great way to have fun while also learning to play! We highly recommend it!

You can hear shells and gunfire in the distance which really gives you a sense of danger when you're approaching the next hedgerow or village.

"This game is an absolute must-play, with its fun combat and captivating story. Despite its linearity and lack of diverging options, this game makes up for it with its top-notch quality. This is particularly evident in the main character's story, which is especially moving due to his forced separation from his love interest. The battle system is also well done, though some fights do get a bit long.

I enjoyed playing each mobile suit to see their moves and super attacks, some of which are both impressive and useful for clearing a field of enemies.

"The last time I played Kingdom Hearts was when it was first released on PS2, and I enjoyed it so much I beat it. After so many years, it was great to play it again in 3D. I highly recommend this game to teen and adult gamers who are looking for something not as childish as some of Nintendo's releases. It has the perfect combination of Disney and Final Fantasy to appeal to all ages. Although I haven't gotten too far into the story yet, I can tell it's going to be great.

"The first level after the tutorial is tough, especially if you're new to real-time strategy games. It's like jumping into the deep end of the pool. The difficulty of the campaigns wasn't very enjoyable, as it seemed to rely on overwhelming numbers rather than good AI. However, there are some great features, such as huge maps, tech trees, updated graphics, and well-balanced units. Plus, the random scenario generator is great for a few hours of play.

"I'm a huge sports fan so I was very excited when NBA2K came out last year. I was even put as a tester for NFL2K1 and NBA2K1 which was really cool. When I got my copy of the game today, it was working pretty well. The new additions this year are a franchise mode, a street mode, and a network mode. Franchise mode was really fun since it was my first basketball game. The street mode was my favorite part where you can customize your team with legendary or current players and play on one of several cool street courts. I don't know if you can play street mode online yet, but when I try to hit the network mode, it crashes. Graphics have improved slightly, but the sound is much better with good commentary.

"In my opinion, Dragonball Z Budokai is the most polished of all the Budokai console games. Dimps went the extra mile to give fans a game that captures the look and feel of the series. There are 23 characters to choose from, seven modes to try, and familiar locations to fight in. Additionally, there is an unlockable skill edit feature that allows players to customize their characters, fighting techniques, and abilities. The story mode is grand in presentation, but could have been longer. Nevertheless, this game offers a lot of promise and is sure to be entertaining for both fighting game fans and Dragonball Z fans.",budokai one polished budokai console games opinion dimps went extra mile fans game captures look feel series theres 23 characters choose 7 modes try familiar locations fight unlockable skill edit feature customize characters fighting techniques abilities story mode grand presentation could longer game offers lot promise sure entertain fighting game fans dragonball z fans
"I believe this is one of the greatest role-playing games out there. Although the story and characters may be more suitable for younger gamers, the gameplay is great. The battles are turn-based, but you get to use special attacks and star power to do extra damage. You can also cook and combine items to make them better. The different worlds are enjoyable, ranging from dark, creepy forests to snow and ice-filled lands. The music is good, though not something you'd buy the soundtrack for. The game isn't too hard or too easy, but may require a few gameovers. I found the game to be entertaining throughout and even played it multiple times.

The atmosphere of the game is incredibly eerie, with dark angles and interiors that make you feel like you're in the movie. The ""trust/fear mechanism"" is a unique feature that allows you to interact with the people you meet, and gives you the opportunity to either calm them down or test them for signs of being an alien. The aliens themselves are horrifying, and the best way to deal with them is to use a flame-thrower. There's also plenty of gore and the characters have unwashed mouths.

"Doom is back in this 64-bit installment of the series. It features the same classic gameplay, but with 32 new levels, one new weapon (the Laser), and one new enemy type (the final boss, the ""Mother of all Demons""). The graphics are notably better than those of previous Doom games, with high resolution textures, and the ambient soundtrack and sound effects are also impressive. One downside is that the game is quite dark during gameplay, there is no multiplayer option, and without a controller pak, the passwords are harder to remember.

"Sly Cooper 3 is finally available for Playstation 2! It has some great new features, like new playable characters, multiplayer, and new moves. There are lots of levels, such as Venice (where you can play as Sly, Bentley, Murray, and Carmelita), the Australian Outback (where you can play as Sly, Bentley, Murray, and The Guru), Holland (where you can play as Sly, Bentley, Murray, The Guru, Penelope, and Carmelita), and China (where you can play as Sly, Bentley, Murray, The Guru, Penelope, and The Panda King). When it comes to multiplayer, there are several different options. You can play as Sly or Carmelita and try to steal loot, or you can team up as Bentley and Penelope to hack computers. There's also a biplane battle where you can play as Sly or Carmelita and the first one to get ten kills wins, and a pirate battle where you play as Sly or Bentley and try to destroy each other's ships. Overall, this game is better than the first two because of the new features and characters, and it gets a 10/10 rating. It's definitely worth buying, and if you don't have the money, you can rent it. It's a must-have for Sly Cooper fans, but if you haven't played the first two games, you won't get as much out of it.",finally got sly 3 honor among thieves ps2 sly 3 great new features new playable characters multiplayer new moves lots levels venice sly bentley murray carmelita australian outback sly bentley murray guru holland sly bentley murray guru penelope carmelita china sly bentley murray guru penelope panda king multiplayer different options sly carmelita steal loot team bentley penelope hack computers biplane battle sly carmelita first get ten kills wins pirate battle sly bentley try destroy others ships overall sly 3 better first two new features characters 1010 definitely worth buying dont money rent must sly cooper fan played first two games get much

"If you liked the previous game, you'll love this one even more. The save system has been improved to allow up to three saves, so you don't have to worry about making mistakes. There are also more zombies and a combo system which allows you to make weapons like in Fallout 3. You play as a guy in a game set in Las Vegas who has to save his daughter and find out why he was framed. Along the way, you do side missions to save people and fight psychos who often hold people hostage. Anything in the environment can be used to kill zombies. You can also mix drinks to boost abilities. This game is very fun, has an interesting story, and the controls are better than the last title. There are also some surprises in the story.

"I am a big fan of Nintendo and have owned all of their major systems, with the GameCube being the first of this generation. I am pleased with the games that Nintendo offers, as they are some of the best in the industry. The graphics and audio capabilities of the system are impressive, and it is also very portable with a handle for easy carrying. The controller is also very ergonomic and easy to use. However, there are some drawbacks - there are many major titles that have not been released on the GameCube, even if they are on XBox and PS2. Additionally, memory cards are required to use the system, and there is no hard drive available.

"I've had this game for almost two years and I bought it to play with friends online. Although I was a bit apprehensive, I found it to be quite enjoyable. The single player is less tactical and more squad-based than previous Clancy games, which can be both good and bad depending on the player's preferences. The story is decent and there are plenty of weapons and badges to unlock. The environment is partially destructible and has a great cover system. The online portion is enjoyable if you can find a server, and there are two main modes: terrorist hunt and versus. Terrorist hunt has you and 2-3 others hunting down computer players, while versus is you and your team against other people. Overall, it's a good and fun game, but Ubisoft didn't put much effort into patches so there are some annoying bugs.",rainbow six siege ive game almost 2 years bought play friends online bit skeptical actually really fun single player less tactical previous clancy games squad based good bad depending player story decent plenty weapons badges unlock environment partially destructible great cover system online portion enjoyable find server 2 main modes terrorist hunt versus terrorist hunt 2 3 others hunting computer players versus team people ubisoft didnt much effort patches annoying bugs

The humor is outstanding, the animation is extremely accurate, and the game play is engaging. The Grand Wizard statue is huge and looks great in my collection. Amazon messed up the release date by one day, but I was so excited that I found the game online. I had planned to return it, but after playing for seven hours straight and laughing the whole time, I decided it wouldn't be fair to Matt and Trey.

The controls are easy to use and the graphics are even better than Diablo II, but may be too much for lower end machines. The game is based on Diablo and Diablo II, so it isn't very original, but it has enough diversity to keep you entertained.

"This is a great chess game for those just starting out, as it offers a tutorial to help teach the rules, piece movements, and basic tactics. It also has six mini-games with 20 levels each to help develop basic chess thinking techniques. Chess puzzles are generated each time and the game keeps track of your rating, best times and mini-games scores. The playing strength is challenging for most players at around 1850. However, the computer opponent will always play the same move each time in the same position, leading to limited opening variations. The chess puzzles are only answered in one move and only three games can be saved at a time. There is no online multiplayer, but you can play another person with their own DS and gamecard if they are in the same place as you.

"I have been extremely unhappy with SquareSoft's recent releases, which have been mostly disappointing. Chrono Cross (CC) is an exception to this, however, and is a shining example of what a modern RPG should be. I bought CC the day it came out and only got to play it for an hour before it was taken from me. It has since been ""borrowed"" multiple times, which is a testament to how great the game is. In contrast, Legend of Mana (LoM) and Threads of Fate (ToF) are not up to the same standard as CC.

"If you have played Bioware's ""Knights of the Old Republic"", you may find ""Mass Effect"" to be somewhat disappointing. Despite some positive aspects, the numerous unpolished components make it a less than ideal experience. With six more months of refinement, the game may have been significantly improved. Additionally, the decision to combine elements of ""Gears of War"" with KOTOR was unsuccessful. Furthermore, the game is relatively short, taking about 30 hours to complete all of the side missions, and does not have the same level of content and complexity as ""Oblivion"". The graphics are a mixed bag, with impressive facial models and lip-synching in dialogue scenes, but less impressive in-game details and frame rate drops in skirmishes. The sound, however, is the best attribute of the game, with great voice-acting, ambient and weapons sounds, and musical score. The game-play is a major downfall, with poor frame-rate drops, uninspiring magic powers and weapons, and a hokey ""Halo"" vehicle. Additionally, the inability to directly control partner characters and clunky menu system for weapons and upgrades limits the RPG elements. The story is also a mixed bag, with a good main story, but repetitive and boring side missions. It is possible that Bioware was pressured to release the game for the holiday season, as evidenced by the large number of names in the QA department in the closing credits. It could have been beneficial to delay the game until the first quarter of 2008, as Rock Star did with GTA IV, in order to avoid competition.",mass effect somewhat disappointing especially played biowares kotor positives game numerous unpolished components another six months development game could significantly improved decision combine kotor elements gears war wasnt successful game relatively short takes 30 hours complete side missions doesnt level content complexity oblivion graphics mixed bag impressive facial models lipsynching dialogue scenes less impressive ingame details frame rate drops skirmishes sound best attribute game great voiceacting ambient weapons sounds musical score gameplay major downfall poor frame rate drops uninspiring magic powers weapons hokey halo vehicle inability directly control partner characters clunky menu system weapons upgrades limits rpg elements story mixed bag good main story repetitive boring side missions bioware pressured release game holiday season evidenced large number names qa department closing credits would beneficial delay game first quarter 2008 rock star gta iv competition

And when it comes to melee weapons, you have plenty of options to choose from, including a hammer, baseball bat, golf club, shovel, and fire axe.

"I have not had a lot of experience with the Xbox One controller yet, but based on what I have experienced so far, I absolutely love it. I was surprised because I had not enjoyed the Xbox 360 controller, which was larger than this one, yet it fit comfortably in my hands. The triggers are great, the D-pad is very responsive, and there is no longer a bulky battery pack. The only issue I have is that the analog sticks could be a bit bigger, however that is a minor issue. Compared to the PS4 controller, I would give the advantage to the Xbox One controller as I found it easier to get used to. All in all, I think this controller is fantastic and would give it a rating of 5 out of 5.",xbox xboxuk xboxsupport xboxonecontroller xboxone xboxseriesx xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseriesxreview xboxseries

"This game is an absolute blast to play! My wife and I have been playing it for days and even my friend who usually plays Call of Duty was hooked after watching us. It's goofy and colorful, but it's still appealing. You do need Xbox Live Gold and an EA Origin account to play, and there is no single-player option, but the online multiplayer and split-screen modes are great. The Garden Ops mode is lots of fun, and the Gardens&Graveyards; mode up to 24 players can be a bit challenging but is still enjoyable. You can earn coins by completing objectives and then use them in the Sticker Shop to get booster packs with characters, items and abilities.

"This game was truly amazing - I was so hooked that I stayed up until 2AM multiple times in order to find out what would happen next. The graphics, sound, scripting, story, weapons, environments, vehicles, battles, puzzles, creatures, striders, and map design were all top-notch. The water effect alone was worth the $50.00. The only downside was that the last level was too easy and the ending was a bit too vague. I was hoping for a grand revelation and a more difficult puzzle at the end that would make me question which side I was really on. All in all, an awesome game that left the door open for Half Life 3 - I just hope it doesn't take another 5 years!",game truly amazing got hooked stayed till 2am multiple times see would happen next graphics sound scripting story weapons environments vehicles battles puzzles creatures striders map design top notch water effect alone worth 5000 downside last level easy ending bit vague wanted grand revelation difficult puzzle end would make question side really awesome game left door open half life 3 hope doesnt take another 5 years
"I have all the LEGO video games and it's great to see how they've developed. LEGO Lord of the Rings follows the open world concept from LEGO Batman 2, but unfortunately it has more glitches. Pros include an open world, all three movies/books covered, side quests that add hours of gameplay, and beautiful graphics. Cons include the metal objects that need to be blown up to 100% a level not breaking, having to look up a guide to find the pattern to blow up metal objects, and not as much LEGO humor. If you like LEGO and Lord of the Rings, you'll enjoy this game, but be aware of the glitches and make sure to install it on the hard drive.",lego videogames love see developed lego lord rings follows open world concept lego batman 2 unfortunately glitches pros open world three moviesbooks covered side quests add hours gameplay beautiful graphics cons metal objects need blown 100 level breaking looking guide find pattern blow metal objects much legohumor like lego lotr enjoy game aware glitches install hard drive
"I recently had the chance to try out 4-way cooperative action with this product and it was a great experience. The detailed graphics and overall game play were still great, despite the few flaws this game has. It was also really convenient to have a friend just plug in their controller and start playing without having to quit the current mission and start from scratch. Even though you have to play on a quarter of a TV screen, the frame rate was still very smooth during the action-packed sequences. You don't have to set up a special mission profile to play cooperatively either; you can just pick up where you left off in single player mode. This is the only shooter I have that offers 4-way cooperative action, and for those of us who don't have Live or enough fellow Xboxers to do system link, it's a real blessing.

"I've been buying the Madden football series since 2000, and while I've been disappointed with the lack of realism in the game play and the feeling that I'm just paying for roster updates, Backbreaker has been a breath of fresh air. The controls allow for a more natural feel, and it feels like you're actually playing football. Playing quarterback is especially realistic. Although this game isn't perfect, it's a great start and a far superior alternative to Madden.

"Many people seem to be disappointed with this game, but I'm not one of them. The visuals are great, with excellent detail given to units, buildings, and terrain. There is also a good story and special attack features for units. The online gaming at boneyards is where the game really shines and is highly competitive. Unfortunately, the soundtrack is not great and there is too much silence while playing. Additionally, some battles feature narrow passages where only two units can stand side by side, making it difficult to get into. I would rate this game closer to 3 1/2 stars, but I still enjoyed it because of the various characters and battles.",game seems like lot people disappointed im one visuals great detail units buildings terrain good story special attack features units online gaming boneyards game really shines highly competitive soundtrack isnt great much silence playing battles feature narrow passages two units stand side side make difficult get 3 12 stars closer 3 12 still enjoyed various characters battles

"In order to download this DLC, you must first get the Steam platform, which I have no issues with. It's not listed as compatible with Windows 8 on the Amazon page, but it works fine on that operating system. As a huge fan of The Walking Dead, I was excited to get this DLC, but it was not at all what I expected. Without giving away spoilers, I can say that the game did not have a satisfying ending, and I thought this DLC would pick up where it left off, but it doesn't. It's made up of five very short stories that have nothing to do with the original game, and each one can be completed in about five minutes. I wouldn't recommend paying much for this DLC, as you will likely be disappointed.",want download dlc first need get steam platform fine thats listed compatible windows 8 amazon page works great windows 8 huge fan walking dead game thought ending unsatisfying game left open dlc thought would pick left doesnt made 5 short stories nothing original game complete 5 minutes wouldnt pay much dlc likely disappointed

"The first person shooter genre is often criticized for this game, as it is third person, does not involve guns and does not have online co-op play. However, this is a sword and spell game which includes the ability to ride various monsters with special powers. You can dodge, block or even interupt some attacks. Additionally, there are minigames and the ability to replay levels while gaining new looks and stronger swords.

"LCT is an excellent arcade-style shooter with around 10 levels, and is a great way to test out your Zapper (or other third-party light gun holders such as the Pega light gun). The multiplayer is a blast, and fans of Twilight Princess will appreciate the references in the game. The Zapper itself is a bit uncomfortable and small, and the cord wraps around underneath the Zapper in a closed compartment. If you just want the game, you can probably find it on eBay or Amazon for less than $10 and use the Wiimote or a better third-party light gun attachment. Zelda fans and FPS fans should buy the bundle regardless though, as it is best for younger players or those with smaller hands.",lct great arcade style shooter around 10 levels good way test zapper third party light gun holders pega light gun multiplayer blast references twilight princess zapper bit uncomfortable small cord wraps underneath zapper closed compartment game bundled wii probably find ebay amazon less 10 use wiimote better third party light gun attachment zelda fans fps fans buy bundle regardless best younger players smaller hands
"This game is designed for an adult audience, not just because of its violence, but because of its focus on relationships and subtleties.

"Mario, Nintendo's beloved mascot, was featured in the hugely successful Mario 64 game for the Nintendo 64 console. Since then, Nintendo has been trying to create a sequel or successor, with Mario Sunshine not quite living up to expectations. Paper Mario, with its 2D characters in 3D backgrounds, then came along. Now, its true sequel has arrived and it is a vast improvement on the original. The basic story remains the same - Princess Toadstool has been kidnapped and Mario must save the day by defeating Bowser - but this time it is linked to a mysterious treasure map and the Thousand Year Door. The graphics are beautiful, though not as bright as Mario Sunshine or as detailed as Resident Evil 4. The sound and music are fitting, though not immediately catchy, and voice acting is limited to Mario's catchphrases. The gameplay is what really sets this game apart. Mario can fold himself into a plane, squash himself and launch himself into the air, or squeeze through tight spaces. Battles take place on a stage with an audience, who can react positively or negatively to Mario's performance. The dialogue is much improved from Paper Mario 64, with Bowser's line ""Crystal Stars you say? They sound like world conquering tools, I want them!"" being particularly memorable. Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door is one of the Gamecube's must-play titles and it is a shame that it is overlooked in favour of other games.",paper mario thousand year door gamecube mario 64 success nintendo tried create sequel successor mario 64 mario sunshine didnt quite live mario 64 paper mario 2d characters 3d backgrounds true sequel arrived vast improvement basic story princess toadstool kidnapped mario save day defeating bowser time linked mysterious treasure map thousand year door graphics beautiful though bright mario sunshine detailed resident evil 4 sound music fitting though immediately catchy voice acting limited marios catchphrases gameplay really sets game apart mario fold plane squash launch air squeeze tight spaces battles take place stage audience react positively negatively marios performance dialogue much improved paper mario 64 bower crystal stars say sound like worldconquering tools want papermario

The control is precise and the game runs smoothly. The music is good and the announcers can be turned off if they become too repetitive. The challenge of the game lies in the increasingly difficult AI and longer, more curved tracks. It's a fun and repetitive arcade racer with an emphasis on sliding through turns and using nitrous boosts strategically.

"I enjoy the thrill of a powerful car. Deciding which racing game was great was difficult for me, especially with titles like Gran Turismo, Crash Bandicoot Tag Team Racing, and the classic Need For Speed series. Since its release in the late 90's, Need For Speed has been one of the most intense and outrageous racing games. Fans of the Underground series have seen the craziness of street racing at its peak. Now, that madness has returned with Need For Speed: Underground 2 for the Playstation 2. The goal is to become the best of the underground racing world by driving around the city of Bayside. You can unlock cars like the Subaru Impreza WRX, the Mazda Miata, and SUV's like the Hummer H2 and the Lincoln Navagator. It's not just about the speed of the car, it's also about how you design it to make your experience as extreme as you want it to be. The graphics and gameplay are excellent and the music is a mix of Rap and Hip Hop to hard-driven Rock. The controls are simple to get used to, but when playing drag races, you must make sure your car is on manual transmission. One disadvantage is that you can spend too much time trying to find races in the Bayside area, which can be frustrating. All in all, Need For Speed Underground 2 for the PS2 is a great buy for race fans. While many are considering Need For Speed Most Wanted over Underground 2, this might be a better game for those who cannot master the ferocity of the Most Wanted era. This is a must buy for Playstation 2 owners or anyone who has the need for speed.",need speed underground 2 ps2 great game need speed series one intense outrageous racing games since late 90s need speed underground 2 fans underground series saw madness street racing peak madness returned need speed underground 2 ps2 goal become best underground racing world driving around city bayside unlock cars like subaru impreza wrx mazda miata suvs like hummer h2 lincoln navagator not speed car also design car experience extreme want graphics gameplay excellent music mix rap hip hop harddriven rock controls simple get used playing drag races make sure car manual transmission one disadvantage spend time trying find races bayside area frustrating need speed underground 2 ps2 great buy race fans many considering need speed wanted need speed underground 2 might better game cannot master ferocity wanted era must buy playstation 2 owners anyone need speed

"I didn't even bother finishing this title because it was riddled with bugs from the start, making it unplayable. For example, I wrecked one of my cars by running into a sandcastle. There's also not much of a challenge, since the metal bars have the same durability as a wooden plank and you can't die if you play smart. The graphics are also outdated, which is a shame since this game had so much potential. I'd only recommend buying it if you can find it on a good sale, but even then, it's only worth a maximum of $20.",didnt even bother finishing title game riddled bugs start unplayable example wrecked one cars running sandcastle also isnt much challenge metal bars durability wooden plank cant die play smart graphics outdated shame game much potential id buy game
"I was really excited when I heard this game was coming out. It had been a while since I felt that same kind of anticipation for a Pok&eacute;mon game. While Sapphire will always be my favorite, I think objectively this game (Black or White 2) is the best one in the series. It has all the elements of a perfect Pok&eacute;mon game - great music, personalized themes for each gym, an engaging plot, good graphics, post-story adventures, and a huge selection of Pok&eacute;mon. Riolu is available early in the game, but be careful - many of the Pok&eacute;mon have moves that are super effective against steel types like Lucario, and fighting types like Emboar. All in all, this game is really great. If you're wondering if it's worth it, the answer is yes - it's worth every penny.

"This was the first Rayman game I had ever played, and I'm now a fan. The graphics are gorgeous, with vibrant colors and backgrounds that look like they were hand-drawn or watercolored. The controls are easy to use and dying doesn't have much of an impact since you're brought back to your last checkpoint. Playing alone can feel a bit disjointed since you have to switch between characters and playstyles, but the touchpad makes it easier. The story isn't particularly impressive, but there are extras like lucky scratch cards and collectibles that make it more rewarding. The introduction and voice acting set an epic mood, but it didn't carry through the start of the game.",rayman legends ps4 review beautiful game great graphics vibrant colours backgrounds look hand drawn watercolours controls easy die much impact brought back checkpoint last played touchpad makes easier playing alone bit disjointed switch characters playstyles story isnt great extras lucky scratch cards collectibles introduction voice acting set epic mood didnt carry start

"I'm not usually a fan of Rockstar's game development, and I've never been into any of the GTA titles. However, I found that Red Dead Redemption was a great game in its own right, without being GTA on a horse. If you're into westerns and like a large, free roam environment, then this is the game for you. It has 57 story missions in the southern U.S. and Mexico, which will take a decent amount of time to complete. To fully complete the game, you'll need to work on the free roam challenges, which involve hunting, gambling, and exploring the areas that may be easily overlooked. I would recommend this game, although I must warn that it has a slow, realistic pace. It can take some time for the game to get going, and you may end up doing side quests or main quests that don't directly contribute to the storyline.",im usually fan rockstar game development ive never got gta titles ive played red dead redemption great game without gta horse westerns large free roam environment game 57 story missions southern us mexico decent amount time complete free roam challenges hunting gambling exploring areas may easily overlooked would recommend game slow realistic pace takes time get going may end doing side quests main quests directly contribute storyline

"I have recently tried out both Battlefield 1942 and Vietnam and I have to say that I am now considering going back to playing board games. The movement in these games is so slow compared to other first person shooters like Call of Duty, which makes me think that the creators should be embarrassed. You do get to drive around in tanks, planes and jeeps, but it's often a struggle to get into the driver's seat and actually get going. The battles are so unrealistic that I struggle to call it a war game. The look and feel of the game is not great and after about half an hour I was ready to delete it from my system, which I did. I know that some people may think it's great, but for me, these games were just awful.

"Bully is an iconic game that puts a humorous spin on the typical high school experience. Players take on the role of Jimmy Hopkins, who is dropped off at a seemingly great but disfunctional school full of drunk teachers, cliques, and bullies. The story is full of witty remarks and is sure to have players in stitches. The gameplay is decent, but the fighting system could use some tweaking. The characters are over-the-top and make the story even more entertaining. Classes are also fun mini-games which can help players earn skills. The only downside is that the game is relatively short, and the town of Bullsworth isn't as large as expected. Despite this, parents should not fear that their children will become violent or delinquent as a result of playing this game, as it is rated T for a reason and does not contain guns, killing, maiming, sex, or knives.",bully classic game take typical high school experience put humorous spin players take jimmy hopkins dropped seemingly great school full drunk teachers cliques bullies story full witty remarks sure players stitches gameplay decent fighting system could use tweaking characters overthetop make story even entertaining classes fun minigames help players earn skills downside game relatively short town bullsworth isnt large expected parents need fear children become violent delinquent playing game rated reason doesnt contain guns killing maiming sex knives

The gameplay is smooth and the weapons are fun to use. The puzzles can be a bit annoying, but they do add some variety. The graphics and audio are spectacular, creating an atmosphere of fear and tension. The game is about 10-12 hours long, but there are plenty of reasons to come back, such as unlocks and trophies.

"I had the privilege of playing the NES and SNES versions of Castlevania, as well as SOTN on the Playstation, and completely missed out on the N64 versions. Lament of Innocence for the PS2 is Castlevania in 3D, and understandably similar to Devil May Cry. You use a whip to perform combos and subweapons to defeat enemies, as well as combining them with orbs for different types of attacks. I had plenty of fun playing it, but it was over quickly - I beat it within a week. However, I'm sure some players take longer as there are hidden things in the game, like relics, that are not easily found. After beating the game, you can play as an alternate character, but it's not worth it as it's not as complete as the original. To sum it up, this is a 3D version of Castlevania that stays true to the original feel of the game, but it's not as long or complete as some would hope. It's a conversation between fans and producers - fans wanting a 3D version of Castlevania that is good, and producers delivering it, but not in the same way as before.",castlevania lament innocence ps2 3d castlevania game think dmc whip combos subweapons use orbs different types attacks fun beat week sure players longer hidden things game relics beat game play alternate character worth complete original

"I'm a big fan of this series and I think the writing and dialogue are outstanding. The action sequences and the levels are both dynamic and visually stunning. It also has some of the best storytelling of any video game. Uncharted 3 does not disappoint and continues the high standards set by the first two. The hand-to-hand combat is incredibly fun, and there are plenty of well-dressed villains to fight. The story is great, although I still prefer Uncharted 2, as the progression was better in that game. All in all, if you loved the first two games, you'll love this one too.

"Although it may be a bit pricey, this product works well and the installation video on the PDP website is helpful.

"In 2004, Killzone was released and it was over-hyped by the gaming media. It was supposed to be Sony's answer to Halo, and it failed to live up to the expectations. Despite its flaws, I bought this game and I ended up loving it. I played through the campaign multiple times and moved on to the PS3 in 2008. Last year, Sony announced that Killzone would be released as a PlayStation 2 classic title but it was delayed. Now, Sony has released an HD port of Killzone along with a trilogy pack for a great price. Although the game is still buggy and the graphics are dated, it is still very entertaining. You can also customize the controller layout and it is exactly what I remember it to be. This is a great package and I feel like I got a steal.

"The graphics and the story of The Witcher 2 are as good as the original game. However, the combat system is not as satisfactory, as it consists of weak and strong attacks that cannot be interrupted, and there is no targeting dot, making it difficult to attack the correct enemy. The beginning of the game is also quite challenging, as you will often find yourself in battles with multiple enemies, resulting in high damage taken. Furthermore, the story does not capture the player as much as the first Witcher game. If the combat system was improved, the game would have been twice as enjoyable, however, the story keeps the player engaged, making it a fairly enjoyable game, though not as much as its predecessor.",witcher 2 graphics story good original game however combat system satisfactory consists weak strong attacks cannot interrupted theres targeting dot attack correct enemy beginning game challenging often find battles multiple enemies high dmg

If you're looking for a challenge and appreciate sports games, then you'll enjoy all the features of this game. With some practice, you can learn to do all the tactical moves, such as the risk shots, as well as the A.I. in the game.

"I am very pleased that Capcom chose not to collaborate with Ubisoft for this port, as it seems to be of good quality. The graphics are outstanding (another review even said that they are better than the console versions, although I don't have a console to compare it to), and the cutscenes are of high quality. The game itself is stable and runs smoothly. The game is entertaining, however I could have done without the co-op partner. The inventory is small and it is not possible to increase it; Sheva also has an inventory to store more items. Ammo is not as plentiful as in RE4, so you must be careful with your shots. The AI is not perfect, and I experienced a glitch where Sheva picked up the land mines I had planted. It is possible to chain together submission moves to handle mobs effectively. The story is not special, but it mirrors RE4 in some ways. You must use LIVE to save progress, which I am not a fan of. The game is playable with both a mouse and a 360 controller, but you still cannot move and shoot at the same time. The quick-action button combination pressing during cutscenes is awkward at first, but it becomes easier with practice. Overall, this is an entertaining game with good replay value. I paid $45 for it due to a pre-order special on Steam, and I think it was worth it. The game runs well on my computer, which has a Pentium dual-core processor clocked at 2.2Ghz, 4GB DDR2 RAM, and a GeForce 250GTS. The game has relatively low system requirements.",capcom im glad capcom didnt choose ubisoft port good quality graphics amazing another review said better console versions although dont console compare cutscenes high quality game stable runs smoothly game entertaining could done without co op partner inventory small possible increase inventory sheva also inventory store items ammo plentiful re4 must careful shots ai isnt perfect glitch sheva pick land mines planted chain together submission moves handle mobs effectively story isnt special mirrors re4 ways must live save progress fan game playable mouse 360 controller cant move shoot time quick action button combination pressing cutscenes awkward first becomes easier practice entertaining game good replay value paid 45 due preorder special steam worth game runs well computer pentium dual core processor clocked 22ghz 4gb ddr2 ram geforce 250gts game relatively low system requirements

There are 13 characters to choose from, but mastering one of them will take time. The controls are very simple, with only three main buttons (kick, punch, guard) and no evade button from VF3. However, don't think this is just another button-mashing game, as it requires skill and precision to execute some advanced combos. Each character has their own stances and moves, and the action is faster than its predecessors but not so fast that it becomes frantic. Recovery from knockdowns is also faster.

There are also some fun modes to play, such as a Tournament mode and minigames. Although it does not have an RPG mode like Mario Tennis: Power Tour for GBA, it still provides a great experience.

"At first, I thought this game was just a copy of Resident Evil 4, but after playing it I realized it was much more. It has an open, yet closed path to follow, and the atmosphere is much darker and more mysterious. It really captures the feel of classic zombie movies, even though the enemies aren't technically zombies. They're controlled by four-legged bugs called Exocells. The pistol is the only weapon with a flashlight, which isn't ideal, but the game is definitely worth buying and playing.",first thought game basically resident evil 4 clone playing game realize much game open path closed path follow atmosphere much darker mysterious classic zombie movie feel although enemies technically zombies controlled 4 legged bugs called exocells pistol weapon flashlight isnt ideal game definitely worth buying playing

"I would never give a ND game less than 3 stars, as I'm a huge fan of them. Unfortunately, this game was a bit of a let down. I think it was because I had to wait so long for it to be released, and I'm not a fan of games with bodies of water. Deception Island was not one of my favorites either. The golf cart, sailboat and monkeys were all very frustrating. I think they should leave out Bess and George - I prefer calling them. I needed to use a walk-thru about 4 times, and the ending puzzle was a complete guess. The Legend of The Crystal Skull remains my favorite ND game. Even though Ransom wasn't what I was expecting, I will still continue to buy ND games as they are generally very good.

The game has a strong storyline that children can follow easily, with animated stories between levels to explain what is happening.

Then you get close to the ""Loreless"" Metroid and have to fight nine new Metroids, making a total of 48 (or 49 if you include the Queen).

"Despite the criticism Super Mario Bros 2 has received for being so ""different"" and ""un-Mario"", I think it is a fantastic game! Nintendo of America decided to take a Japanese game, Doki Doki Panic, and put Mario and the gang into it to create Super Mario Bros 2. The game revolves around the ability to pick up items, like vegetables, enemies, and other objects, and use them to complete tasks. It also has one of the best final boss encounters on the NES.

"Football season has arrived and the newest Madden game is out. I have been buying the Madden games since the Sega Genesis days and EA Sports has always done a good job of creating a fun and exciting football simulation. However, this year's Madden 06 (for PS2, Xbox, Game Cube) has been affected by EA's exclusive NFL rights and the lack of competition. Last year, Visual Concepts' series NFL 2K lowered the price of their games, hitting EA hard. Despite this, Madden 06 is still a good football game with a few glitches and fewer expansive upgrades. It has new features such as Superstar Mode and the passing icon functions. The passing icon functions were a bit cumbersome and I found it unnecessary, so I was glad you could turn it off. Superstar Mode was fun and it allowed you to create a player from scratch and experience what an NFL player has to deal with. Graphically, the game has not changed much since Madden 2004 and EA could have done more tweaks here and there. Madden 06 will be out sometime this fall, and it will be interesting to see if the game took a different approach. Overall, Madden 06 is enjoyable but not groundbreaking. People are ready to see something different with the next-gen Madden and hopefully, it will be worth the wait.",football season upon us newest madden game hit shelves ive buying madden games since sega genesis days ea sports always done good job creating fun exciting football simulation however year madden 06 ps2 xbox game cube affected eas exclusive nfl rights lack competition last year visual concepts series nfl 2k lowered price games hitting ea hard madden 06 still good football game glitches fewer expansive upgrades new features superstar mode passing icon functions passing icon functions bit cumbersome found unnecessary glad could turn superstar mode fun allows create player scratch experience nfl player deal graphically game changed much since madden 2004 ea could done tweaks madden 06 sometime fall interesting see game took different approach overall madden 06 enjoyable groundbreaking people ready see something different nextgen madden hopefully worth wait

I think they should have remade Symphony of the Night like they did Rondo of Blood, and made it available without having to unlock it, since Symphony of the Night was the best Castlevania game ever. The franchise has gone downhill since then, in my opinion.

However, the game was lacking voice chat, which is a big issue when it comes to teamwork. Additionally, the AI teammates weren't very smart, making it hard to get them to focus on the goal in both single player and online bot matches.

"This game is likely to please fans of the original Ghost Recon, as it is much closer to the original game than the sequels on Xbox. Those who prefer the run and gun style of games such as Halo and Gears of War may find it too slow and intricate. As a Ghost, you will often be taking out targets from a distance, and the HUD will show you if you are landing shots. Enemies are fewer, but more deadly, and the cover mechanic is essential. The squad AI is sharp, and you can direct your sniper to take out particular enemies from far away. You can also control and direct support entities, though the single command interface can be frustrating. Helicopter rail shooting rounds out the tech-heavy combat sequences. Whether or not you will enjoy this game depends on your preference; FPS fans may find the clips too small and the emphasis on defense constraining, while those looking for a more realistic take on military simulation will find it better than Call of Duty 4.

"I got this game when it first came out, but my video card was too weak to run it properly. So, I upgraded my video card and added more RAM, and it worked fine until I got to a large area. Even though I am above the system requirements, I still experienced frame rate drops from 70 to 7 frames per second. It seemed cool, but I stopped playing it due to the poor performance. I'm hoping to play it again when I get my new computer.

"Finally, this 3D Samurai Shodown game that nobody asked for has been released. Visually, the intro and character select screens are quite stunning. However, the fighting engine is a combination of Dynasty Warriors and Soulblade, which has ruined the beloved original four games. The gameplay, character design, and hit detection are all terrible. The only replay value to be found in this game is as a less humane alternative to waterboarding. There are fatalities present, however, they do not add anything to the overall gameplay. Samurai Shodown Sen is not what the series was about and it never will be, it is the result of the top half of the game development division working on Pachinko machines and the rest of the team violating legacies.",finally 3d samurai shodown game nobody asked visually intro character select screens quite stunning fighting engine combination dynasty warriors soulblade ruined beloved original four games gameplay character design hit detection terrible replay value less humane alternative waterboarding fatalities present however add anything overall gameplay samurai shodown sen series never top half game development division working pachinko machines rest team violating legacies

"Valve once again proves that they can create a successful sequel with Portal 2. It is just as engaging and difficult as the original game in The Orange Box. Players should play the first Portal before starting Portal 2, as it is a direct sequel. The game begins with a robot trying to help the player escape the facility they are stuck in. Portal 2 also has some of the best writing around, with characters like Cave Johnson being worthy of their own titles. The gameplay is the same as the first, with a gun-like device shooting portals. To make the game more challenging, different types of goo are added, which have various effects on the environment. The puzzles are much more difficult than in the first game and require a lot of perseverance and experimentation to solve. There is also a multiplayer aspect to the game, with players guiding two robots through test chambers. For PS3 players, Steam is integrated which allows them to download a free copy of Portal 2 to their PC and play against PC players. The only negative thing about Portal 2 is that it eventually ends.

"This mouse is great for me, even though I'm not a PC gaming expert. I recently bought a laptop and wanted to play Diablo 3 and Torchlight 1 & 2, so I decided to look for a wired mouse since wireless mice can cause lag. I found Steelseries, which is one of the top manufacturers of PC gaming accessories. The mouse is the perfect size for my hand and the side buttons are comfortable, although the two on the right can be awkward to get to. The rubberized coating on the top is nice and doesn't get sticky after using it for a while. It is accurate and very responsive, and it seems to be well-crafted with a braided cord. I like the look of the mouse, and the blinking lights are a nice touch. They can be adjusted for speed and intensity, and they only glow red, which is appropriate for Diablo. This is a great mouse for anyone who likes Diablo or the design.",great mouse im not pc gaming expert recently bought gaming laptop wanted play diablo 3 torchlight 1 2 decided wired mouse wireless mice cause lag i found steelseries one top manufacturers pc gaming accessories mouse perfect size hand side buttons comfortable though two right awkward get used rubberized coating top nice doesnt get sticky using accurate responsive seems well crafted braided cord like look mouse blinking lights nice touch theyre speed intensity adjusted glow red appropriate diablo great mouse anyone likes diablo design
"I was new to the game and I had a lot of success at first. I was ahead of the competition in terms of technology and I expanded to some new areas with oil and grapes.

"This racing simulator is a great game and I enjoy it more than the other GTs, except for the original. The graphics are good, except for the cars which can't compete with Forza's, but they had to make some compromises due to the large number of cars. At first, I thought the game was too easy until I took off the driving assists, then it was a real challenge, like driving in real life. It feels like you are taming a wild beast when you drive a high-horsepower car, and you have to be gentle with it or it will bite back. I like the faster loading and easier navigating menu setup. The car interiors are nicely done and the light reflects off them, but not annoyingly on the windshield. While some people may call this game GT 5 1/2, I think it is different enough to stand up to Forza 5, which is impressive considering how old the PS3 system specs are. I hope it eventually gets remade for the PS4, because then it would be the top dog.",gt6 great game enjoy gt3gt4 gt2gt1 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt1 gt2 gt5 gt6 gt1 gt2 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt1 gt2 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt1 gt2 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt1 gt2 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt6 gt3 gt4 gt5 gt
"I was delighted to find this discounted copy of the original Super Mario Galaxy game. After playing and almost completing Super Mario Galaxy 2, I wanted to go back to this one, which I remember enjoying more, to understand why. A part of it is the orbital platform design that Mario returns to after each galaxy. Flying around the galaxy on a large, goofy-looking Mario head is just enjoyable to me. I also like having a home base to come back to. However, there are issues with this title that SMG2 addressed well. One of them is the terrible camera angle and controls in the underwater levels - you often can't see where you are going due to the awkward camera movement, which makes it very easy to run into unseen enemies. The controls in the underwater parts are also not great. In other places, the level design and controls are so poor that it takes away all the fun from the level, for example, one level where Mario is forced to race a Boo through a pull star path. The pull star mechanic is interesting, but too slow and clumsy to make it a good race. Fortunately, it's easy to get enough bonus stars in other levels so you can skip the not-fun levels and move on to something else. I'm about 75% of the way through the game and have mostly enjoyed it, though the controls are not as precise as Super Mario 3D Land, which is probably the best of the 3D Mario titles available.",super mario galaxy nintendo wii 2007 disc game case nintendo wii 2007 super mario galaxy wii 2007 disc game case 2007 game case super mario galaxy wii 2007 game case 2007 game case wii disc super mario galaxy wii 2007 game case 2007 game case wii disc httpswwwamazoncomdpb000fqbpcgrefcmswrpidpx5q9ad7m0m4jg via amazon 1 found discount copy original super mario galaxy game delighted played almost completed super mario galaxy 2 wanted go back one remember enjoying understand part orbital platform design mario returns galaxy flying around galaxy large goofy looking mario head enjoyable also like home base come back however title issues smg2 addressed well terrible camera angle controls underwater levels often see going due awkward camera movement makes easy run unseen enemies controls underwater parts also great places level design controls poor takes away fun level example one level mario forced race boo pull star path pull star mechanic interesting slow clumsy make good race fortunately easy get enough bonus stars levels skip notfun levels move something else im 75 way game mostly enjoyed controls precise super mario 3d land probably best 3d mario titles available

"I recently bought this game from Amazon and had a blast playing it. The controls are different from other games, the plot is well-crafted, and the characters are all unique. The Chocobo side quest is a great way to turn a bad mood around. It can be frustrating at times, but who doesn't love riding a Chocobo around the world? The battle system is a bit slow in my opinion. Compared to Final Fantasy VIII, it takes longer for the action to be taken after you enter it. This can make boss battles quite difficult when you're trying to heal and the boss gets an attack in before you can heal.",got game few weeks ago amazon really enjoying far controls different games story well done characters unique chocobo side quest great way turn bad mood around frustrating times love riding chocobo around world battle system bit slow imo compared ff8 takes longer action taken enter makes boss battles quite difficult trying heal boss gets attack heal

"After hearing many positive reviews about the Tales series, I decided to buy Tales of the Abyss for my 3DS. This RPG has a lengthy game with expansive landscapes and an intricate, captivating story. However, it does have a few minor problems. The graphics are great, but the 3D effect is slightly choppy or pixelated in some scenes. Despite this, I still played most of the game in 2D mode. The storyline is intriguing and full of unexpected plot twists. The content is also quite lengthy, taking me about 45 hours to finish my first playthrough. The gameplay is the weakest part of the game, as the battles are repetitive and the ""Free Run"" system is not as fun as a turn-based battle system. Despite this, I would still recommend buying this game. The long and interesting story will keep you entertained for at least five days, and the minor issues with the gameplay are not enough to detract from the overall experience.

"I really enjoy this game, despite what some gaming sites say about it being boring until the last two missions. Right from the start, it offers an exciting experience, and the last two missions are even more intense. The graphics are remarkable, and the lighting and detail are quite impressive. The characters in the game are not as well done, however. The sound is great and the idea of dropping into the battle from above is cool, but it doesn't last long. The enemy AI is good, as they will raise their gun over their head and fire or throw a grenade over their shoulder from behind a box. The only real downside is how short the game is, and the online play is good but lacks the objective play of the original MOHAA. Additionally, the game is advertised as being non-linear, but it isn't all that way. You have to beat all the objectives to open the last ones, which I didn't find particularly interesting. At $50, which is what it was when I purchased it, the game is a bit expensive.

"I had a lot of doubts about Batman: Arkham Asylum when it was first released. I was worried that it would be like many other superhero/comic games, which are usually terrible, and the reviews of the game's design choices were not very encouraging. The demo wasn't that great either. Fortunately, Rocksteady managed to make one of the best games in recent memory. You play as Batman and escort the Joker through Arkham Asylum as the credits roll. The controls are easy to use and you can perform some great combat moves and use Batman's arsenal of gadgets with just the press of one or two buttons. The stealth elements are also straightforward and add to the atmosphere of the game. Even if you're not an experienced gamer, you can still have fun playing this game.

"This game is not your typical action game or RPG, but it is a great experience. It has a deep and complicated story about an assassin from many years ago. The gameplay is a bit repetitive, but it will become more enjoyable as you go along due to the different enemies and strategies you can use. It takes a while for the game to really get good but the payoff is worth it, as you become more skilled in combat and can take on multiple foes at once. The most fun is being able to fight openly and challenge your enemies. However, it is not recommended to do this early on in the game as your weapons and abilities are limited. The end of the game is easier than expected and the payoff is a cliffhanger, however the replay value is limited and the game may occasionally freeze. Despite this, I enjoyed this game a lot.",this isnt typical action game rpg though great experience deep complicated story assassin many years ago gameplay bit repetitive become enjoyable go due different enemies strategies use takes while game really good payoff worth become skilled combat take multiple foes fun openly challenge enemies though dont recommended early game weapons abilities limited end game easier expected payoff cliffhanger replay value limited game freeze enjoyed game lot

"Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks is a challenging action-adventure game with lots of combat in a style similar to Devil May Cry. It features two-player co-op, allowing you and a friend to beat the game together. There are cool combos and fighting moves to keep the game interesting, as well as a versus mode similar to Power Stone. The graphics are sub-par, but acceptable, and some sections of the game can be annoying. When you unlock other characters like Sub-Zero and Scorpion, you still get the same story involving Lu Kang and Kung Lao. Additionally, some unlockable content is difficult to get. This game is quite bloody and gory, so it is not suitable for small children or those sensitive to such material. The combat consists of simple combos, strikes, and puzzles, and can be taken to another level with a second player. Most of the game must be unlocked through hidden secrets in each stage. Die-hard Mortal Kombat fans should definitely play this game, as it fills the gap between Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat II. It is the third action-adventure game set in the Mortal Kombat universe, after Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat: Special Forces (starring Jax). There are some nice unlockables, including a full version of the classic Mortal Kombat 2.

Players can travel to iconic Marvel Universe locations such as Namor's Atlantis and Mephisto's Realm. The game can become repetitive, and the voice acting is not always great.

It came with everything I needed, including a controller, headset, and Kinect (which I use with the Forza Head tracking system). It's black and rectangular, and it looks great with my gaming setup. The controller is even better than I expected - lighter and better grip. The Kinect works great (although it needs some updates, which I'm sure Microsoft will provide). Games can be put into standby mode and will start up from where you left off. Cons: Updates - this is something that was an issue with the previous generation, and it's still an issue now.

"For the cost, it's a good deal to get three decent shooters. The first game, which was originally a PS2 release, is a bit outdated but wasn't too bad and it set up the plot for the other two. The second game focused on rebalancing, but removed secondary fire. For example, the ISA assault rifle was given accuracy and more common ammo drops, while the Helghast LMG was weakened and only effective at close range. The difficulty was also increased, which is a point of argument among fans. The third game balanced out certain aspects, such as the Helghast LMG having some accuracy and the difficulty being lowered to maintain the challenge but not make it too easy. Additionally, there are more vehicles, a good stealth mission, and enemies who take cover and try to surround you.

Additionally, the cars seemed to flip over too easily and couldn't go faster than 80 mph. The AI of the drone cars was also quite poor, often getting in the way unnecessarily.

Players take on the roles of the Prince Of Midenhall, the Prince Of Cannock, and the Princess Of Moonbrooke as they embark on a quest to defeat an evil wizard and a powerful monster called Malroth in order to restore peace to the land.

"This game is good overall and it only took five days to get the platinum playing a few hours a night. I found it to be somewhat repetitive, though, with the same villains appearing in each map. Many people have complained about the farming at the end, but I didn't have this problem. My advice for making it more enjoyable is to play on normal difficulty until you are comfortable with the controls and constructs, then switch to Emerald Knight difficulty and you should have no problem completing it with more than 200,000 points. I completed all 10 missions and only missed one collectible in chapter nine. It was easy to get the platinum. For a movie/super hero game, it was quite enjoyable, although it was repetitive for me.

Initially, I thought my mic was broken because the documentation for Rock Band is very sparse, and the microphone has less than two lines about setup. I then learned that the singer needs to have an Xbox controller to register the mic and to select songs. There is also a widget that allows you to use your Xbox headset as a mic, although I haven't been able to get that to work yet. My six-year-old was mesmerized by the microphone and I let him sing while I played drums.

"This game, made by Rock Star, is reminiscent of the GTA III series. It has the same poor graphics and lack of attention to detail that make Japanese games superior and American games seem inferior.

"VF4 is an incredible game that does a lot of small things exceptionally well. It has a unique game engine that requires players to form a bond with their character and use them frequently as no fighter's moves can be figured out in one sitting. It is a Fighter's Fighter, offering a challenge to those who seek it. There is a 13-man roster with characters that have hundreds of moves and unique looks and real fighting styles.

"Jet Set Radio Future (JSRF) is a sequel to the Dreamcast's Jet Grind Radio (JGR), which didn't receive a lot of attention from casual gamers. However, JSRF is getting the attention of both hardcore and casual gamers. The game is set in 2024, when you and your group have to compete with other gangs to mark your territory with spray paint. It won't be easy, as rival gangs and the police will be after you. Whereas JGR was mostly a platform game, SEGA has promised that JSRF will be more action-oriented.

"This game is a great return to classic J-RPG roots. It has great characters, dialogue, story, plot, and voice acting (in both Japanese and synced to the on-screen action). After only two chapters, I was reminded of my last great JRPG experience, Final Fantasy VIII on PS1. There are cute optional side-story missions, customizable characters that show their changes in the cut-scenes, an engaging battle system, and a difficult but rewarding difficulty level. If you're playing on a PS3, here's a helpful tip to give you a free mission battle retry: hit start after you clear a room hex and select ""Suspend,"" quit the game to the XMB, copy the ""Suspend"" save data to a USB drive, resume the game, quit, and restore the copy of your USB suspend data if you accidentally die, hero gauge breaks, etc.",game great return classic jrpg roots characters dialogue story plot voice acting great both japanese synced onscreen action two chapters reminded last great jrpg experience final fantasy viii ps1 cute optional sidestory missions customizable characters show changes cutscenes engaging battle system difficult rewarding difficulty level playing ps3 helpful tip give free mission battle retry hit start clear room hex select suspend quit game xmb copy suspend save data usb drive resume game quit restore copy usb suspend data accidentally die hero gauge breaks etc

This is a $20 peripheral, yet people are paying two, three, and even four times more for it (I have seen it listed for $80+). If you order it directly from Nintendo, it will only cost $26.05 ($19.99 plus $6.05 in taxes and shipping/handling). I have done a lot of shopping on this site, but the pricing of these CPP's and my reviews being censored is very disheartening.

"Finding a game to replace Final Fantasy 7 was no doubt a difficult task, and the limited amount of time the original team had to work together only added to the challenge. Unfortunately, Final Fantasy Tactics was a disappointment. The story was too long and drawn out, and the animation and music were often sloppy. What was most disappointing, however, was the lack of proofreading in the text; many scenes were riddled with misspellings and incorrect grammar. The plot was convoluted and confusing, with a war that had no clear goal and a lot of characters that seemed to come and go without explanation. Despite these issues, the well-designed battlefields were a saving grace, as was the character Ramza, whose fate was never fully revealed. Ultimately, it seems that the game was rushed to the stores, and it is a shame that Square didn't take more time to craft what Video Game Spot called ""a masterpiece"".",ff7 replacement no doubt hard find team original ff7 limited time work together ff tactics disappointment story long drawn animation music sloppy proofreading text scenes misspellings grammar plot convoluted confused war clear goal lots characters come go explanation well designed battlefields ramza character fate never fully revealed rushed stores shame square didnt take time craft masterpiece video game spot
"I really enjoy this well-rounded strategy game. It combines real-time strategy, pure strategy, tank or air sim, and even some lighthearted shooter aspects. The graphics are decent and the sound is okay, although the voices can get a bit drowned out by the music. The controls are alright, although sometimes hitting even a rock can damage your vehicle and the AI pathing can be a bit rough. The carrier is a great feature, and the enemies die easily enough - even my own units, which is great because I don't like overly challenging games.

"I had the original version of the game on PS3 and thought it would be great to have a portable version with the extra content that the Ultimate Version offers. Unfortunately, the graphics on the Vita version of Injustice aren't as good as the PS3 version, though they are still decent. I found that the game began to lag on certain stages, which was especially noticeable during the final battle against Superman. The soundtrack is great, but it's best listened to with headphones. The controls are very responsive and easy to use on the Vita, though my hand began to cramp after a while. The game has a lot of content and is worth the full price, although I wish there was a patch to remove the lag and the ability to transfer saved game progress from the PS3 version. If you're a fan of fighting games, this one is great. If you don't own the original, I'd suggest buying the Ultimate Version for the PS3.

"This game is currently unplayable due to an unexpected server blackout, which is not the first one. I have played the game recently and here are my impressions. As my first MMO, I cannot compare it to others. The Star Trek license is a plus, as is the graphics and soundtrack. Space battles, modifications of Federation ships, and a good and fast promotion system (4 days to become a Lt. Com.) are all positives. However, there is only one server for the whole world, meaning the chat can be interesting in terms of learning foreign languages, but there are often queues. Additionally, the same mission (rescuing Starbase 24) can be played multiple times and yield good equipment, but this can be seen as a negative. Cryptic is hardworking on patches, but the game was released too early, leading to ground missions lacking orientation for newbies, no diplomatic missions, and little exploration missions. There is also no balancing, with hostile ships often killing the player immediately, and the Romulans being stronger than the Klingons. The game is expensive, with a full price to buy the game, a fee per month, and an online shop with additional fees for content. There are also several bugs, such as the game crashing to the desktop when the Windows key is pressed. Furthermore, one cannot go over the decks of their own ship (only the bridge is available) and there is no Captain's Room. There is also not much alternation in the missions, and one cannot fly through the wormhole near DS9.",startrekonline game unplayable server blackout unexpected one first played recently impressions first mmo cant compare star trek license plus graphics soundtrack spacebattles modification federation ships good fast promotion 4 days lt com one server whole world chat interesting learning foreign languages often queues good equipment mission rescuing starbase 24 played times cryptic hardworking patches game released early ground missions lacking orientation newbies diplomatic missions little exploration missions balancing hostile ships often killing player immediately romulans stronger klingons expensive full price buy game fee per month online shop additional fees content bugs game crashes desktop pressing windows key cant go decks ship bridge captains room much alternation missions fly wormhole near ds9

"This game doesn't seem to capture the spirit of Resident Evil. It's not particularly frightening, and the setting is strange - bright daylight in Africa. It's also very mission-based, making it feel more like a chore than a fun game. The graphics are excellent, and the bonus features are cool. However, the final boss, Wesker, is a huge letdown. In the Gamecube series, he was a brilliant strategist who used his intelligence to achieve his goals. In this game, he's just a crazy, evil guy. It's clear that the writers were just trying to wrap up the 10-year storyline.

"I really enjoyed playing Mass Effect, Jade Empire and KOTR, so much so that I even completed Mass Effect twice. However, when it came to Dragon Age, I found myself getting frustrated and eventually stopped playing. The autosave system only occurred sporadically and wasn't always useful, so I found myself having to save constantly to avoid losing hours of progress. Additionally, there were several times where I was unable to approach a situation the way I wanted to, such as having my rogues stealthed, but being forced to enter a conversation with someone so they could tell me to attack them. Furthermore, there were random encounters that put me in a situation where the outcome was determined by how I acted in the first few moments, which required a lot of trial and error. All of this made the game difficulty inconsistent and I often found myself breezing through hundreds of enemies and then suddenly being wiped out in a single encounter. If there had been a better autosave system, I wouldn't have minded, but after losing several hours of progress due to forgetting to save and the game crashing, I had to give up on playing Dragon Age.",really enjoy mass effect jade empire kotr even complete mass effect twice dragon age got frustrated quit autosave system sporadic useless found saving constantly avoid losing hours progress also several times unable approach situation way wanted rogues stealthed forced enter conversation someone tell attack also random encounters put situation outcome determined acted first moments lot trial error made game difficulty inconsistent often found myself breezing hundreds enemies suddenly wiped single encounter wouldnt mind autosave system better lost several hours progress due forgetting save game crashing gave playing dragon age

The game looks good, but the AI is not great and the levels are very linear. I got stuck in the Kamchatka level and couldn't complete the last task, which was extremely frustrating.

"I have had numerous headsets from Tritton and Turtle Beach in the past couple of years and I've heard nothing but good things about Astro until the 2013 Edition of the A40s. The Mixamp is a nice addition as it offers four different EQs that match games well. The headset itself is lightweight and comfortable, even for those who wear glasses. Additionally, the cords are detachable, so if one breaks, you don't have to buy a whole new headset. However, the power cord that comes with the headset is faulty and does not work well with the Mixamp. The microphone output is also very quiet and requires a firmware update to improve. For these reasons, I gave this headset two out of five stars as it is a faulty product that does not work properly when purchased.",astro gaming a40 tr headset mixamp pro 2013 edition xbox 360 ps3 pc mac black ive gone countless headsets past couple years tritton turtle beach heard nothing good things astro until got a40s mixamp nice addition gives 4 different eqs match games well headset lightweight comfortable even glasses cords detachable one breaks dont buy new headset power cord comes headset faulty mixamp doesnt work well microphone output really quiet firmware update improve gave 2 stars faulty product bought work properly

"I'm so glad the Paper Mario series started! The first game is still the best, in my opinion, but this one is much more suspenseful and the story is even better. Princess Peach finds a magical map from a strange character in Rogueport and sends a letter to Mario to come help her search for a legendary treasure. Bowser kidnapping Peach isn't the main plot of this game like it is in other Mario titles. The gameplay is complex and there are twists and turns in every chapter. You can still tell it's a Paper Mario game, although it's more 3D-like now. You can fold into a paper airplane, boat, or thin sliver to go through bars. It's really fun and interactive and will keep your interest until the end. My favorite chapter is Glitzville because it's the most suspenseful and fun to play. The least favorite is probably the last chapter, but it does challenge you a lot. I highly recommend getting and playing the first game before this one, because these two Paper Mario games are the best video games ever made!

Oblivion came out and made some changes from Morrowind, but also added in a lot of updates and improved graphics. Skyrim was the next release, and it was absolutely epic. It kept with the Elder Scrolls trends and lore, and added in dragons. The fear and adrenaline of the first dragon encounter was unforgettable. The DLC released for the game has also been great.

"At first, the ""earloop"" design may be a bit uncomfortable, but it can be adjusted to fit comfortably for many people. It is twice the size of most Bluetooth headsets, but it is the first wireless headset for the Xbox 360 so some leeway can be given. The lightweight design somewhat makes up for its size. Connecting with a 360 controller is not a problem. The real issue is when using the headset on Xbox Live. There is no difference in hearing other people than with the regular wired headset, but the microphone is overly sensitive. Players may hear background noises or their own breathing, and this is a byproduct of the wireless headset. The only way to fix this problem is to turn the headset OFF and then back ON again. This may happen once every two hours depending on the game, and if a person plays 20+ hours a week on Xbox Live, it is better to stick with the standard wired headset. Microsoft's proprietary technology means we have to wait until they fix the problem. It is better to buy a normal headset for $10-15 and avoid the frustration of the wireless headset, even though it has dropped in price recently. We may see a ""streamlined"" wireless headset version from Microsoft soon so we won't need to deal with the ""earloop"" design.",xbox 360 wireless headset earloop design may bit uncomfortable first adjusted fit comfortably many people twice size typical bluetooth headset first wireless headset 360 give leeway size lightweight design somewhat makes fit connecting 360 controller problem real issue using headset xbox live hearing people difference regular wired headset microphone overly sensitive players may hear background noises breathing byproduct wireless headset fix problem turn headset fix problem happen every two hours depending game person plays 20 hours week xbox live better stick standard wired headset microsofts proprietary technology wait until fix problem better buy normal headset 1015 avoid frustration wireless headset even though dropped price recently may see streamlined wireless headset version microsoft soon wont need deal earloop design
"I bought my PS3 120 GB when it came out in 2009 and I've been exploring the 'greatest hits' games library ever since. When the price of Bioshock dropped to under $20 in anticipation of the release of Bioshock 2, I decided to give it a go. After completing Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time, I was ready to enter the world of Rapture. The visuals were incredible and the sound design was intense. I would recommend playing Bioshock in surround sound with the volume up, as the various splicers and Big Daddies can be pinpointed by the sounds they make.

"I used to play Cruisin USA a lot when arcade gaming was at its peak, and I was excited to hear it was headed to the Nintendo 64. However, this port is really only for the most dedicated fans of the arcade game, as the good qualities don't quite outweigh the bad. On the plus side, all of the cars, stages, and music from the arcade version are included, and the controls are accurate and easy to pick up. It even includes secret cars that can be unlocked by pressing certain buttons at the selection screen. Unfortunately, this was one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64, which is evident from the choppy graphics and sudden ""pop up"" graphics. The audio was also muffled and muffled, and all the cars controlled the same, meaning there was no difference between them during the stages. If you're a fan of the Cruisin series, you should be aware that this is a decent port of the first game, but it has the same lack of variety in car control and stages as the first arcade game. For that reason, I'm giving this a 3-star rating.",cruisin usa arcade gaming peaked 90s lot time play game excited hear n64 headed port really dedicated fans arcade game good qualities dont quite outweigh bad plus side includes cars stages music arcade version controls accurate easy pick even includes secret cars unlocked pressing certain buttons selection screen unfortunately one first games released n64 evident choppy graphics sudden pop graphics audio muffled muffled cars controlled meaning difference stages youre fan cruisin series know decent port first game lacks variety car control stages first arcade game 3

"This game is excellent, despite a few minor graphical issues. It offers a wide range of activities, characters, and stories, as well as an impressive engine and user-friendly menus. I found myself playing through the game twice in a row, as different actions yielded different outcomes. Making moral choices (like who to sacrifice) was difficult at times, and the combination of shooter, story, and RPG elements worked well. The humorous moments were made even better due to the excellent facial expressions.

"Manhunt is a truly frightening experience, and the sequel proves that it still holds the title of being one of the most disturbing games ever created. You will spend much of your time trying to take out enemies without being detected, and if you are seen, you're in serious trouble. The environment of the game is incredibly creepy and will certainly make you feel uneasy as you carry out your missions. The game can be quite difficult, especially when you're up against more than one enemy which can often result in death. You can use noise to lure enemies into traps, and then attack them in gruesome ways such as suffocating them with a plastic bag or stabbing them with a piece of glass if you hold down the attack button. The game will keep you on your toes as you never know what is coming next and how it will try to kill you. The camera and controls can be a bit problematic, but if you want a game that will truly scare you, then you should definitely pick up Manhunt.",manhunt truly terrifying experience sequel proves still holds title one disturbing games ever created spend much time trying take enemies without getting caught seen youre serious trouble

"I was initially skeptical about MegaMan 6, especially after hearing that it wasn't as good as MegaMan 3 or 2. However, I was pleasantly surprised. There are eight robot masters to fight, two of which were designed by fans who won a contest held by Nintendo Power. The gameplay is enjoyable and there are some new features, such as using Rush as armor to fly or gain super strength. The story was a bit of a letdown, as it was expected that Dr. Wily would be the main villain since this is the sixth game. The graphics are great, as is the music, although it may not be as memorable as the soundtracks from earlier games.

"I have a strong interest in both vampires and first-person shooters, so I was very excited to hear about Darkwatch, created by High Moon Studios. I was particularly impressed with the graphics, which had a dark, gothic, western theme. The controls were also very accurate and easy to use. Additionally, the voiceovers and enemy AI were of high quality. The game also featured a steamy love scene that will surely have people talking. Although it has some shortcomings, such as an unfulfilling storyline and uninspired single-player, Darkwatch is a great FPS game and a promising start to a potentially successful franchise. The multiplayer mode especially stands out, as it utilizes the vampiric powers to its fullest potential. It is the first game to accurately capture the feeling of being in the old west, even with the undead chasing you. I am looking forward to seeing what High Moon Studios will do with the sequel.",interest vampires first person shooters im excited darkwatch high moon studios put lot effort game graphics dark gothic western theme controls accurate easy use voiceovers enemy ai high quality steamy love scene people talk shortcomings unfulfilling storyline uninspired singleplayer darkwatch great fps game promising start potentially successful franchise multiplayer mode especially stands uses vampiric powers fullest potential first game accurately captures feeling old west even undead chasing looking forward high moon studios sequel

"This sequel to the PS2 is much improved. There are many places to explore and lots of things to buy, including a sandrail, buggy, trophy truck, monster truck, golf cart, dirt bike, ATV, airplane and helicopter. It's fun to fly the aircraft, but there's not much else to do with them in free ride mode. Every vehicle has its own races, customizations and paint jobs. The races are very difficult as the computer either cheats or you can easily fall off the bike. The other vehicles are prone to tipping over or don't turn well. The game is great for free ride or multiplayer as there are so many things to do, explore and drive. The graphics are good but similar to other ATV games.

"Since Ultima 7: The Black Gate was released, there haven't been many RPG games that have successfully implemented NPC scheduling beyond that. Although some great RPGs have been released since then, such as Planescape Torment, Baldur's Gate, and Star Wars: Knights of Old Republic, none of them have NPC scheduling. This means that computer-controlled characters, such as a blacksmith, will work in the morning, take a lunch break in the afternoon, continue until dusk, go to the bar for a smoke and a beer, and then go to bed late at night. They will also perform tasks such as going to the forge, hitting the red metal in the anvil, putting the blade in the water bucket, and having an apprentice do some of the work. This is something that is found in Gothic 2, where the city of Khorinis is filled with NPCs doing their daily tasks, some of which have their own hidden objectives that you must help or not help with as subquests. You can choose to help a thief and gain favour with the Thief Guild, or you can turn them in and befriend the militia or paladins. You can also attack someone in the city, but you will be penalized by Lord Andre, the militant chief, depending on how many witnesses saw the fight. As you progress through the game, you have to choose your career path, with five chapters that can take around 8-10 hours to play. You can choose to be a paladin, mercenary, or mage, each of which have their own quests and storylines, giving the game replayability. Gothic 2 stands out from other RPGs, such as Star Wars, in that the quests and storylines are different depending on your career path. This combined with the atmosphere created by NPC scheduling and work cycles, day-night cycles, and quests that are not just Fed Ex type, makes this a great RPG. Khorinis is a place that you can escape to from real life, and if you're a fan of Ultima and were disappointed with Ultima Ascension, you won't regret giving Gothic 2 a try.",since ultima 7 black gate theresnt many rpg games successfully implemented npc scheduling beyond thatalthough great rpg games released since then planescape torment baldur gate star wars knights old republic none npc scheduling blacksmith work morning lunch break afternoon continue dusk go bar smoke beer go bed late night forge hit red metal anvil put blade water bucket apprentice work thats something found gothic 2 city khorinis filled npcs daily tasks hidden objectives help help subquests choose help thief gain favour thief guild turn befriend militia paladins attack someone city penalized lord andre militant chief depending many witnesses saw fight progress game choose career path five chapters take around 810 hours play choose paladin mercenary mage quests storylines giving game replayability gothic 2 stands rpgs star wars quests storylines different depending career path combined atmosphere created npc scheduling work cycles daynight cycles quests fed ex type makes great rpg khorinis place escape real life fan ultima disappointed ultima ascension give gothic 2 try

"Cole MacGrath is voiced by a different actor (who sounds similar to Robert Patrick) and Empire City is no more, having been destroyed by a demonic Goliath known as 'The Beast'. Cole and Zeke then flee to the southern city of New Marais, where Cole is involved in many of the same missions and quests as before. While the blast shards, dead drops, upgrades, and factions all return, so do the problems. Cole's tendency to cling to surfaces makes it difficult to escape conflict or complete race missions, and the camera can be a bit spinny at times. New Marais is a more visually appealing city, and the characters are more likeable, which makes the story missions more enjoyable. If you have a saved game from Infamous, it will be used to instantly upgrade your character when starting the sequel. While the game is still great, Sucker Punch needs to mix it up a bit and fix the flaws in the next installment of the series.",sucker punchs infamous 2 continuation story empire city gets destroyed demonic goliath called beast cole zeke flee southern city new marais cole involved missions quests blast shards dead drops upgrades factions return problems cole clings surfaces making escape conflict complete race missions difficult camera bit spinny new marais visually appealing city characters likeable story missions enjoyable also game great sucker punch needs mix bit fix flaws next installment series cole macgrath voiced different actor sounds like robert patrick

"This game has elements of other games, such as Gears of War, but this makes for a confusing experience. The 'mic' commands interface is awkward and tedious, as it requires the player to use the tab button and F button while simultaneously fighting off bad guys. It is also an afterthought port, as the controls are default Xbox control mapped and the mouse wheel/wheel buttons cannot be used to switch weapons. The combat is standard, and the weapons are unoriginal. There are too many cut scenes which are mostly optional, however they feel like watching a CG movie. The RPG elements and trust system are unnecessary and the character interactions/interaction menu is not interesting. The graphics are standard.

"Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is a great shooter game with a compelling storyline and checkpoints that are timed perfectly. However, it does have some issues, such as an unsatisfactory covering system and poor lip syncing. While it won't become your go-to shooter, it does have some great features such as the music and the story, although it is relatively short. The graphics are good, thanks to the Chrome Engine 4, but the textures are a bit of a mixed bag with some being highly detailed and others being blurry. The game also features a Concentration mode, which allows you to shoot multiple enemies at once, and you can choose to play as either Ray or Thomas, with each character having advantages over the other. There are some bugs, such as missions failing when you move too far away from your brother, and it can be hard to find the dynamite that your opponents have thrown near you. If you are a fan of westerns, have finished all of your other shooters, or just want a change of pace, this game is definitely worth checking out.",boundinblood call juarez bound blood great shooter game good story checkpoints timed perfectly issues unsatisfactory cover system poor lip syncing wont become go shooter features music story relatively short graphics good thanks chrome engine 4 textures mixed bag highly detailed blurry concentration mode allows shoot multiple enemies once choose play either ray thomas character advantages missions fail move far away brother hard find dynamite opponents throw near youve finished shooters worth checking fan westerns httpstcoj8j5l3j0z9

Pros include sailing a boat, discovering extra content, using the sword as if it were real and the fantastic story.

"Doublefine's long-awaited sequel to Psychonauts offers a unique blend of driving, brawling, tactical action, and RTS elements, and its visuals and soundtrack are spectacular. However, the game does not quite live up to the standards of games that focus on one genre. On the positive side, Jack Black and a host of 80s rock stars provide excellent voicework, and the game is full of humorous writing and creative worldbuilding. The controls are responsive and the graphics look great across all platforms. Unfortunately, the brawling isn't as enjoyable as Arkham Asylum, car combat isn't as good as Twisted Metal, and the tactical and RTS elements don't quite measure up to other games in those genres. The camera can also be a nuisance, and the overworld is difficult to navigate. In addition, some strange decisions have been made with combat, such as not allowing players to lock onto an enemy and block at the same time.",psychonauts2 doublefine xboxseriesx psychonauts2 review longawaited sequel offers unique blend driving brawling tactical action rts elements visuals soundtrack arent spectacular game doesnt quite live genre standards positives jack black 80s rock stars provide excellent voicework games full humorous writing creative worldbuilding controls responsive graphics look great across platforms brawling isnt enjoyable arkham asylum car combat isnt good twisted metal tactical rts elements dont quite measure other games genres camera nuisance overworld difficult navigate strange decisions combat lock enemy block time

It's basically SF4 with a lot more content. If you already have SF4, I would highly recommend getting this one as well. For the price I paid, I'm really pleased with it.

"The only positive thing I can say about this game is that they kept the original voice acting from the first three games, the worlds are familiar and the music is great. However, the rest of the game is a letdown. I had played all the previous games, from Spyro the Dragon to Spyro: A New Beginning. The New Legend of Spyro series is terrible, and the one before ANB is not as homey as the original three. This game gets a few points for being close to the old ones, but the graphics are poor, the game play is slow, it is full of glitches and the loading time is awful. I'm not saying this game is utterly terrible and should be excluded from your Spyro collection, but it isn't the best either. This game would have been much better if Insomniac had taken their time with it instead of trying to rush it out for Christmas. If you want a game with good graphics and stunning game play, Spyro: A Hero's Tail is a better choice. But if you want to play the ""little spit of flame"" we used to love on our Playstations, this is the last chance to experience it.

"To the Aussie who was a little bit rude: it's impossible to give an accurate opinion of a game that hasn't been released yet. If a title like FOCOM was a flop, and GBG has similar features, it's understandable to be cautious about writing positive reviews. FOCOM had compatibility issues with video and sound cards, which had nothing to do with PC specs, so it's no surprise that it was disliked.

"Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country proved that flashy graphics don't need to come from CD-based technology. It was later ported to the 8-Bit Game Boy Color, and the graphics still remained colorful and detailed. The sounds and music were also memorable, and the game was a barrel-blasting, Kremling-smashing, animal-romping fun. You can even find and play as Animal Buddies, like a rhino or an ostrich. One of the great things about this version is that it can save anytime, so you don't have to struggle through a level just to get to the save point.

Lines like ""Aim for the open spot!"", ""I'll do you fast, Peppy old pal."", ""Fox, get this guy off me!"" and ""I've got a present for ya!"" are particularly cringe worthy. It raises the question of whether kids should be playing this game or not. The gameplay is enjoyable for the first 15 minutes, but after that it becomes bothersome, annoying and boring. The AI of your teammates is terrible and they never get power-ups. The game is also way too easy and way too short - it can be finished in 30 minutes. Additionally, the voice acting is not great. Hopefully Starfox Adventures will be better than this game as this title should not have started the whole Starfox series.

However, reviews and opinions quickly became mixed as many felt that it was trying too hard to be different. With Age of Mythology, Ensemble Studios took the already successful Age of Kings and completely revamped it, adding a 3-D engine and mythical elements. The gameplay and feel remain similar to Age of Kings, but now it is presented in a 3-D environment. The game features three civilizations, each of which has three gods that offer unique bonuses and powers to the player. Mythical units are incredibly powerful, but they can be defeated if used correctly. The civilizations are also differentiated by the way resources are gathered and used to build structures. The AI in this game is excellent and micromanagement is no longer a priority. Age of Mythology is an outstanding game that any RTS fan should have in their collection.

"I used to play League of Legends, but its community was very toxic. That game got me into esports, but I wanted a better community, so I decided to try out Starcraft 2. I liked that it had a launcher to get balance patches. I enjoyed the campaign, as each mission had a different take on RTS games. It's a good idea to start with the campaign before going to multiplayer. I also liked the story. The A.I. is different, as it sets the level based on the games you have won before. When you start playing against other players, you start at a mid-matchmaking rating. Starcraft 2 is split into three parts, with a campaign for each race.

Sure, the whip-jumps may be difficult and the combo system may take some time to get used to, but the controls are easy to learn. Don't be stuck in the 2D world of the previous Castlevania games and enjoy the evolution of the franchise. This game is great and very enjoyable once you give it a chance. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is crisp and responsive, and the combat system is great with advanced combos to help you fight the tougher enemies. The soundtrack is good, though not superb, and the sound effects are amazing. The only two downsides are the length and story, as the game is a bit short and the ending is a bit anticlimactic.

You can gain points by getting strings of hits done properly and tag special sequences for bonuses. As you progress and unlock secrets, you can also increase the difficulty level of any song to challenge yourself. You can choose from a variety of artists such as No Doubt, Fear Factory, Orbital, Paul Oakenfold, Curve, and The Crystal Method. You can even design your own mixes of the songs.

There are also a lot of other activities to do, such as visiting towns, buying weapons, and upgrading magic and orbs. The visuals and music are great and create a great atmosphere. There are a lot of places to explore, although it can be difficult to collect the Rogress. The voice acting is a bit awkward at first, but it gets better as the game progresses. All in all, this game is a great buy and I highly recommend it. It is long and should not be rented, so I give it two thumbs up!",arc rise fantasia wii played games like one far best interesting mix linear non linear elements story interesting many unexpected twists game play easy travelling usually play larc battles different require careful planning especially rogress lot activities visit towns buy weapons upgrade magic orbs visuals music great create great atmosphere lot places explore although difficult collect rogress voice acting bit awkward first gets better game progresses game great buy highly recommend long rented 2 thumbs
"If you're a fan of horror movies and games, you'll enjoy 'Rise Of Nightmares'. Even though the I.G.N reviewer gave it a poor review, I completely disagree. Sega was treated unfairly. It's true that the game has some issues, but that's to be expected with Kinect. The game ran smoothly, and you don't have to go through a lot of menu screens. I adjusted the turning speed in the options menu and found that the character moved around more easily. This game is a lot of fun and is very gory, like something out of a horror movie.

I had no problems when I charged it twice with my Xbox 360 Quick Charge Kit, but the third time I noticed the lights on the charging kit wouldn't turn on, indicating that there was no battery in it. I left it overnight without the charging kit lights on, but it didn't charge at all. After searching online for a solution, I found that other customers have experienced the same charging issue. I am very disappointed. Additionally, I noticed that this battery is slightly larger than the original Microsoft one and it needs to be forced into the controller a bit, which I did not pay much attention to the two times I used it. However, I have read in other reviews that it can eventually break the controller, so it is important to consider this before buying the product.",purchased spare always one battery ready charging one charge twice noticed third time charging kit lights turn charging kit lights battery left overnight charging kit lights turned charge searched online solution charging issue found customers experienced charging issue disappointed noticed battery slightly larger original microsoft one needs forced controller bit didnt pay attention two times used read reviews eventually break controller consider buying product

"Fable 3 was a game with a lot of hype from the industry, but it didn't quite live up to expectations. The fighting mechanics and graphics were good, and the sound and music was great. The gameplay was fun and the quests were diverse, but the customization could have been better. The weapons were a gamble and the decisions and choices were important in the first part of the game, but the second part didn't really give players the freedom to make their own decisions. The roaming areas were small and the touch features were limited. The freeplay aspect was enjoyable but could get boring quickly. The game had some minor bugs and the best ending was achieved by making smart investments. If you've never played Fable 3, it's worth a try, but if you've already played Fable 2, it might be better to wait until the price drops.",fable 3 game much hype industry didnt quite live fighting mechanics good graphics good sound music great gameplay fun quests diverse customization could better weapons gamble decisions choices important first part game second part didnt really give players freedom make decisions roaming areas small touch features limited freeplay aspect enjoyable could get boring quickly game minor bugs best ending achieved making smart investments never played fable 3 worth try already played fable 2 wait price drop

"This game has a huge cult following, however, the ""wow"" factor quickly fades away when you battle the first Colossus. The surreal, dream-like land and difficult battles are not enough to make up for the lack of content. It is reminiscent of the arcade-style platform games of the original NES and PS, but without the action, adventure or role-playing elements. When you finish the game, you are left with a feeling of emptiness.

"In 1994, Nintendo and Sega were in the midst of a 16-bit battle, so it was common for fans of both systems to argue which one was superior. Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers was released that year and based on the popular arcade game of the same name. Street Fighter and fighting game fans debated which version was best, but there was no doubt that it was a great port that closely mimicked the arcade game. Everyone rejoiced, and for good reason. The game includes 16 fighters, 12 opponents, and bosses to battle, as well as 2 player VS mode, group battle mode, and tournament mode. The graphics, music, and controls are all good, and the difficulty level can be adjusted from 0 to 10 stars. Although some animation frames, announcements, bonus stages, and sound effects were omitted, the game is still a near-perfect port. Fighting game fans will love playing Super Street Fighter II in the comfort of their own homes. Those who are not into fighting games may not want to check it out, but those who do can find a copy online or download the game to the Wii from the Virtual Console Service for 800 points ($8.00 US).",super street fighter ii new challengers snes 1994 nintendo sega 16bitwars bitwars 16bit 90s 90sgaming 90svideogames 90skid snes nintendo sega segagenesis capcom arcade 90sarcade gaming videogames gamer games gamingcommunity retrogaming retrogames retrogame videogamecollection videogamecollector videogamecollecting videogameaddict videogamer videogameaddiction gamingaddict gamingaddiction gamecollector gamecollecting gamecollection gameaddict gameaddiction
"Despite the impressive feat of creating a user-made modification using the Half-Life engine, Gunman Chronicles falls short as a retail game. As someone who has attempted to make their own modifications and conversions for games like Half-Life and Quake 2, I understand the amount of work that goes into a game like this, but I still felt insulted when I remembered that someone wanted money for it. Compared to excellent games like Half-Life and System Shock 2, Gunman Chronicles does not measure up. The visuals are often not very pleasing, and the grainy-looking wall textures contribute to this. The configurable weapons are a nice idea, but the menu system used to access them can be difficult to navigate and becomes frustrating during combat. Additionally, it is often unclear what the player is supposed to do in certain areas of the game, leading to confusion. The voice acting is also terrible. Despite this, the game is still worth trying, especially if you enjoyed Half-Life single player. The configurable weapons are fun to mess around with and it is, after all, the Half-Life engine. It is recommended to download the demo, but if you have extra cash to spare, it is suggested to purchase a different game.",gunman chronicles impressive feat usermade modification using halflife engine falls short retail game ive attempted make modifications conversions games like halflife quake 2 understand amount work goes game still felt insulted remembered someone wanted money excellent games like halflife system shock 2 gunman chronicles measure visuals often pleasing grainylooking wall textures contribute configurable weapons nice idea menu system used access weapons difficult navigate becomes frustrating combat often unclear supposed areas game leading confusion voice acting terrible still worth trying especially enjoyed halflife single player configurable weapons fun mess around half life engine recommended download demo extra cash spare suggested purchase different game

The multiplayer isn't the best, but the first two games have free DLC on the PSN store, and most of Resistance 3's DLC is free, except for the Brutality and Survival packs which are $4 each.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that I couldn't put it down until I had completed the main quest, and there was plenty of extra content to keep me playing afterwards. The main story mode was engaging and I found myself invested in the characters, both the main ones and the side characters. The customization options were vast, with a huge character and item creation system, and multi-classing was challenging and fun. The graphics were lovely, bright and cel-animated but not too cartoonish. The menus and maps were intuitive. There is a ton of content in this game, with items, monsters, equipment, spells, classes, and grottoes/treasure maps.

"I've been on the hunt for an RPG for my XBOX 360 for a while now, and after being disappointed with Blue Dragon (too easy) and Final Fantasy (not great), I've finally found a winner in Star Ocean. The story is like a movie script, set in the future but with a great plot. Most of the characters are great, but a couple of them are really irritating due to their voices. It's a shame that every RPG seems to have one of these annoying characters. The voice acting is okay, although the words don't always match the lip movements. The graphics are nice, if not the best, but the few CG scenes are amazing. The gameplay is great, as it's live action and not turn-based, and you control your character in the fight and can switch between your other party members. There are lots of side quests, weapons, armor and items to create, and lots of searching for the right items to make certain things. The only downside is the lack of save points; you can play for an hour or two before getting to one. I bought a used copy and it's frozen up a couple of times, which is really annoying. The boss battles are relatively easy until the last one, which I spent four hours on! I'm about 60 hours in and I'm really happy that I got this game for $17. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an RPG.",xbox 360 rpg ive looking one finally found one star ocean blue dragon way easy final fantasy great star ocean story like movie script set future great plot most characters great couple really irritating voice every rpg seem one voice acting okay word dont match lip movements graphics nice best few cg scenes amazing gameplay great live action turnbased control character fight switch party members lots side quests weapons armor items create lots searching right items make things downside lack save points play hour two get one bought used copy frozen couple times really annoying boss battles relatively easy last one spent four hours im 60 hours really happy got game 17 recommend anyone looking rpg

"High Heat 2003 for the PS2 is an excellent baseball video game, despite the lack of a Franchise mode. Comparatively, it is on par with Sega's World Series Baseball series on the Dreamcast, with High Heat's Franchise mode being more in-depth. Graphically, the game is great - the players look like their real life counterparts and their pitching styles and batting stances are accurate. The gameplay is good, with pitching involving pressing one of four buttons for a certain pitch and square or circle depending on where you want it to be. However, fielding is a bit of a challenge, as you have to use the control pad instead of the analog stick, making it difficult to tell where you are going. The Franchise mode is great, with features such as trading, retirements, free agent signings, rookie drafts, and minor leagues. The lack of certain features in the gameplay bring the rating down from a 5 to a 4, but it is still an ideal choice for PS2 owners looking for a solid baseball game.",high heat 2003 ps2 excellent baseball game despite lack franchise mode compared segas world series baseball series dreamcast high heat franchise mode depth graphically game great players look like real life counterparts pitching styles batting stances accurate gameplay good pitching involves pressing one four buttons certain pitch square circle depending want fielding bit challenge control pad instead analog stick making difficult tell going franchise mode great features trading retirements free agent signings rookie drafts minor leagues lack certain features gameplay bring rating 5 4 ideal choice ps2 owners looking solid baseball game
"It doesn't take long for the game to include several minigames that are poorly presented and won't be used again once you understand them. I'm very disappointed in the lack of 'truth puzzles', as I found them to be very intriguing due to their vagueness and complexity. Furthermore, the revelations made in this title are not strong enough to follow up from the previous game. Despite this, it was still enjoyable - it's more like Assassins Creed Brotherhood 2.5. The developers should have taken a few more months to really finish the game, as this one has made me question the future of the series.",assassinscreed valhalla review game doesnt take long include several minigames poorly presented wont used understand them im disappointed lack truth puzzles found intriguing due vagueness complexity revelations title doesnt strong follow previous game still enjoyable acbrotherhood 25 devs take few months really finish game one made question future series
"I have almost finished the game and I was enjoying it up until now. The Golems are similar to Pokemon in that they can't evolve or learn new abilities. Here are some of the pros and cons I have noticed: + Fast-paced battles that require strategic thinking. You also have the option to retry a battle if you lose instead of having to reload from a save point. + You can save anywhere in the game, and can change characters if you are using the wrong ones for a particular Golem.+ There are many Golems to use throughout the game. - VP is frustrating. Exploring the Holy Beast Shrine is like a maze, making it difficult to get to a healing spot to increase VP. Each character starts with a certain amount of VP, and if it hits 0 they enter battles with only 1 HP, leaving no chance to escape. - There is a limit of 9 of each healing item. Although the game is fun, it can be frustrating at times like any other RPG.",almost finished game far enjoying golems basically like pokemon cant evolve learn new moves pros fast paced battles require strategy retry option lose battles reload save points save anywhere game change characters using wrong ones golem cons vp frustrating exploring holy beast shrine like maze get healing spot increase vp characters start certain amount vp hits 0 enter battles 1 hp chance escape limit 9 healing items game fun frustrating rpg

"I had the 3DS version of Asphalt and really enjoyed it in spite of the flaws that many reviewers pointed out.

The game has a lot of replayability, with 100 events over 20 leagues to work through. You can also purchase new vehicles and progress through the career mode.

The story was great, though it left some questions unanswered. I was hoping that the expansion would provide the answers, but it looks like that's not the case. Despite this, the game was still really enjoyable, with lots of side quests to do. The only downside was that I got to a point where I couldn't go back, and I didn't realize it until it was too late.

The controls are user-friendly and easy to understand, while the courses offer a good challenge. The game can be completed in four hours, but the real goal is to get three stars on each mission, which can take much longer.

The story links to the original Red Dead game and then develops its own narrative, which I thought was really cool. The price is good for the length of the game, but there's not much replay value. After beating the game, I played for a bit longer to complete some side activities and achievements, but there's not a lot to do. I'd give it 4 stars because it's not amazing, but for the price it's good.

"I was initially not very interested in Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, but my cousin convinced me to give it a try. Set on a beautiful Pacific Island, the races take place across four different environments with eight different types of vehicles. The races are reminiscent of Road Rash, with a no-rules-to-be-broken attitude. However, some of the courses are very difficult and the vehicles have poor handling. For a short burst of entertainment, the game is good for about 10 hours, however, since it is now three years old, there is no one playing online anymore, making it impossible to get the Platinum trophy.

"NFS: Underground 2 was an enjoyable game, even if the riceboi take on it was not very strong. Unfortunately, NFS: Carbon which came after was not as good. Pro Street, however, was terrible.

"I was extremely pleased after finally completing FF13, and was eager to start playing this game. I was not disappointed, as this game was even better than the last one. The first 20-30 minutes of playing this game alone is worth the price of admission (especially since it is only $20 now!). The opening scene where you control Lightning and Odin as they battle Bahamut was truly remarkable and was some of the most fun I have had this console generation. Although the battle was easy, it was light years ahead of FF13's combat. I was a bit disappointed that there weren't more sequences like this throughout the game. The battle remains fast-paced, fun, and rewarding throughout the game, following the blueprint established in FF13. The story is whacky, as is expected from a Final Fantasy game, but you just need to embrace it. The music in this game was awesome, except for the occasional heavy metal tune during boss battles. The leveling system is ""okay"", but not as good as FF13's. After playing this game and watching the tech demo ""Agni's Philosophy"", I am excited to see what Square Enix will create for PS4. It was a difficult console generation for Japanese developers, but the leaders have survived and are doing better than ever.

"I am very satisfied with the game I chose for my Xbox One! It is a lot of fun, similar to Call of Duty with giant robots and Battlefield-like maps.

I definitely recommend picking this game up if you have just purchased an Xbox One or need a game for it. I got mine for around $30, so hopefully you can find a good deal too.

I bought it and it worked perfectly. It not only allows you to play Gameboy games without an actual Gameboy, but you can also modify colors, set a background, and edit controls. The pros are that it has tons of extra features and good emulation, but it can sometimes affect games with battery-backed files and can't play Game Boy Color games. It can only display 4 colors in a game.

"I had a great time playing this console and video game system while it lasted. The wireless controls were easy to use and the batteries lasted a few days if you had rechargeable ones. The graphics were great, especially with games like Gears of War, Dead Space, and Mass Effect. The sound was also awesome. However, after two years of safe and moderate use, it abruptly stopped working and was diagnosed with the ""Red Ring of Death"". I was very disappointed and upset with Microsoft and the XBox, and if I had known this would happen, I would have bought the Sony PS3 instead. Microsoft is covering the repairs under warranty, but I'm still out of an XBox for a few weeks while it gets shipped to Texas. I'm also seeing reviews of problems after the consoles have been repaired, so I'm not very optimistic.",great time playing console video game system lasted wireless controls easy use batteries lasted days rechargeable graphics great especially games like gears war dead space mass effect sound awesome however two years safe moderate use abruptly stopped working diagnosed red ring death im extremely disappointed upset microsoft xbox known would happen would bought sony ps3 instead microsoft covering repairs warranty im still xbox weeks gets shipped texas also seeing reviews problems consoles repaired im optimistic
"Many people seem to disagree with me, but I found this version to be a significant downgrade from the original. Here are the pros and cons: Pros: new classes (which aren't great and reuse animations/skills from the old game), two new characters (which again, are not that good), the ""improved"" dialogue (which I actually disliked more than the old dialogue), some tweaks and balance fixes (which are beneficial), and new cinematics. The only two pros that are truly positive, in my opinion, are the tweaks/balance fixes and the cinematics. However, the old cinematics had a certain charm to them, so I don't mind going without them. Cons: slowdown that is extremely frustrating if you have played the original, the new writing is terrible (I had been excited to hear that it had been rewritten to make it less confusing and better than the old, poorly translated version, but it is even worse with confusing Old English language and poor grammar), the audio quality has been downgraded (the soundtrack is amazing, and the music reverberates beautifully in the original game, but sounds flat and dull in the new version), the resolution is lower (at least on the Vita - the original PS1 version looks better), there is more clicking needed to confirm movements and actions (which gets irritating quickly, even after turning part of it off in the options), and there is an annoying confirmation sound for every piece of dialogue (which I was never able to turn off, but it was not in the original - the original had some nice page-turning sounds). Overall, this port is not a good representation of such an incredible game. If you have a Vita and don't mind the lack of fullscreen, just get the original game from the store - it's cheaper anyway. After playing both versions on the Vita, I was saddened to see how much better the original was than the new one.",many people seem disagree found version significant downgrade original pros new classes great reuse animationsskills old game new characters also great reuse animationskills old game improved dialogue actually disliked old dialogue tweaksbalance fixes beneficial new cinematics new cinematics old ones charm though dont mind going without cons slowdown extremely frustrating played original new writing terrible excited hear rewritten make less confusing better old poorly translated version even worse confusing old english language poor grammar audio quality downgraded soundtrack amazing music reverberates beautifully original game sounds flat dull new version resolution lower least vita original ps1 version looks better clicking needed confirm movements actions gets irritating quickly turning part options annoying confirmation sound every piece dialogue never able turn original original nice pageturning sounds port isnt good representation incredible game vita dont mind lack fullscreen get original game store cheaper anyway played versions vita saddened see much better original
"This bundle includes a red dualshock 3 and the God of War Origins Collection, which features HD remakes of the PSP God of War games. According to the box, buying this bundle saves you $34, as dualshocks usually cost around $55 and the Origins Collection is usually $40. This is an incredible deal. The only downside is that the games are quite short; they were originally on UMDs, so they are only around 4 to 5 hours long due to technical constraints of the PSP game disc.

"Ground Control is a unique real time strategy game that stands out from the crowd due to its lack of resource management. This means that instead of building up your base and defenses, it's just an all-out fight to the death.

There are 30 single player missions and a tutorial to get you up to speed quickly. The plot is interesting and the missions are challenging, even for experienced strategy gamers.

"This game is a great sequel to the fantastic Arkham Asylum. The environment, story and gameplay are all top-notch, and the graphics are stunning (using DX9, as DX11 caused a lot of frame rate issues on my powerful PC). The voice acting is just as great as in Asylum, and the Joker trophies are more difficult. Playing as Catwoman is a nice change of pace, although the female characters could have been presented in a more modern way. Unfortunately, the game shipped with a lot of game-breaking bugs, but they were fixed when I switched to DX11 and the latest Nvidia drivers. Reviews say DX11 doesn't add much to the game, and it still looks great without it. The only downside is the triple DRM system: Steam, Windows Live, and the five installation limit.

One minute there would be loud pounding music and then it would suddenly become silent for a long time. The action was minimal, just running up to the monster and attacking. After the first 30 minutes, the game was no longer enjoyable. The graphics weren't even up to the standard of the PSone (or maybe the Super Nintendo).

"I have had this case for about a year and used it as the only cover for my Vita. Initially, it was great as the grips were cushioned for comfort. Unfortunately, there is no screen protection if the system gets dropped and lands on the front or back. However, if it falls and lands on the side, the case does its job and prevents any damage. Additionally, the mini storage card cannot be accessed with the cover on and it is difficult to open the game slot. On the other hand, the charger is easy to get to and the comfort is good, making it easy to play the system for hours. Recently, however, the piece has been separating, with the cover coming off the plastic attached to the Vita. Despite this, this product is a good value and I would recommend it.

What makes this one special is that it's challenging enough for players of all skill levels, while still being beatable. The controls are smooth and intuitive, using just the A and B buttons. B fires your primary weapon, while A selects your power-ups (lasers, force fields, speed, and missiles). The graphics and music for this game (released in 1991) are great. The best part of the game is the ability to customize your power-ups and shields to fit whatever situation you're in. You can even change up your game each time you play by choosing one of the three difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, and Hard). Just don't use the Konami code while paused, as it's a suicide code!

This is a departure from the usual Zelda games, as it takes place outside of Hyrule and there are no ancient history lessons. Link is even accompanied by a Chain Chomp as a sidekick. The dungeons were well-designed, and the mini-bosses served as checkpoints. I especially liked the top-down view in one of the dungeons, where Link had to jump over a rolling pole. The AI was great, with villagers going about their business. It was also quite large for a Gameboy game.

"The first installment of Resident Evil on the GameCube is a prequel to the entire series. The backstory of Rebecca Chambers is revealed, and the controls are typical of the Resident Evil games. The visuals are stunning, with cut-scenes and character movements that stay true to the RE remake and expand in certain ways. The gameplay is familiar to fans, involving searching, exploring, and unlocking puzzles. The addition of the buddy system is a double-edged sword, allowing the two characters (Rebecca Chambers and Billy Coen) to explore different areas and come together to take down enemies. The sound is one of the creepiest in RE history, with every movement and music adding to the atmosphere. This is a great new addition to the Resident Evil series, and with more RE games due out in 2003, the series will live on.",resident evil 0 gamecube first installment series prequel entire series reveals backstory rebecca chambers controls typical resident evil games visuals stunning cutscenes character movements stay true re remake expand certain ways
"I think this game is the best one I have ever played. It is a hidden object game, but the more interesting and challenging part is what you have to do with the items you collect. You have to explore many locations and go back to some of them a few times. You must think carefully about which inventory object to use and how to use it when you encounter a problem or situation. The inventory items are not just in the hidden scenes, but also in some of the locations. I even looked at a blog walkthrough to make sure I had done everything. The mini games are also excellent, including a maze-like alphabet game. The storyline is about four grad students looking for the truth about a Celtic legend in Dire Grove. You also collect 18 VHS tapes that tell the story. I found the game to be quite immersive due to the snowy environment. I wish I had known about the deluxe version before I bought the standard one, as I would definitely consider buying it after some time passes. Lastly, there is a text guide that comments on your actions. It has three modes, one of them being sarcastic, but I had to change it because it was too insulting.",mcf dire grove best game ive ever played hidden object game interesting challenging part collect items hidden scenes use items inventory explore many locations go back locations time think carefully inventory item use encounter problem

"This game is clearly inspired by Total Annihilation, though it can't be an official sequel due to legal rights. The graphics have been improved, but the large battles can cause lag and the visuals don't feel worth it. The campaign missions are playable, but the story is not up to par with other RTS games and can be quite frustrating. If you have an older graphics card, don't buy this game as it won't even start. Even if you have a compatible card, expect the game to run slowly. This game is essentially Total Annihilation with a new look, though the new look can sometimes get in the way of the fun.

"This game is one of the best offerings on the Xbox 360, and its fun factor, graphics, replay value, and audio are all rated at a 10/10. However, there are some small issues with the AI and interface that hold it back, and the lack of an in-game tutorial makes the learning curve steeper than it needs to be. The auto-saves are also few and far between. The combat system is great once you get past the learning curve, and the ability to pause the game and issue commands makes it more like a classic RPG than a third-person shooter. The open-ended game play is something missing from most games, and the story line and voice acting are of an A-list blockbuster quality. All in all, this game is highly recommended.",xbox 360 review mass effect 910 fun factor 10 graphics 10 replay 10 audio 10 issues ai interface hold back otherwise game auto saves far between combat system great get past learning curve ability pause game issue commands make game classic rpg thirdperson shooter openended game play something missing games story line voice acting a list blockbuster highly recommended

"I absolutely loved this game! Killing smart and fast dinosaurs is much more challenging than killing mindless zombies, and the game has a lot of surprises. It is quite gory, but it doesn't quite compare to the goryness of RE games. Despite the fact that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, I still consider it one of the best survival-horrors. The game has too many puzzles and not enough dinosaur killing, with 50 puzzles followed by 10 dinos, then 50 puzzles again followed by 10 dinos. However, the graphics, sound, and FMV's are great, and the game has its fun moments, like when the T-Rex comes out. The T-Rex plays a similar role to the Nemises in RE3, as they are both invincible enemies that keep showing up. Aside from the T-Rex and the Raptors there are 3 other deadly dinosaurs: Compys, flying bird dinosaurs, and a big, strong, weird-looking creature. Ammo is very hard to find in the game, and the AI is very good, as the dinosaurs can smell your blood from a different hall and start stalking you.

"Shenmue is one of the best graphically-rendered games available for the Dreamcast console. Players get to fight a group of angry angels (which is quite amusing). Despite its greatness, the game is unfortunately too short, considering that it is composed of three discs. The story follows Ryo Hazuki, a character from the Hazuki Dojo in Yamanose, whose father was murdered by the mysterious Lan Di. Ryo's main objective is to seek revenge, but he is unable to fight Lan Di until he meets Shenhua Jona and defeats him. There are sixteen Shenmues in total, and the weather and time settings are surprisingly accurate.

Additionally, the footsteps of nearby enemies give away their presence. The environment is also highly destructible, with buildings, trees, bridges, and even grenades and mortar strikes leaving craters in the ground.

It has unique puzzle shapes and ""locked"" cells that add difficulty to the typical match-3 game play. What I most enjoyed was the built-in screen saver. It is a virtual aquarium, with 22 species of fish and 3 different reef backgrounds. You can unlock new fish when you complete certain levels, which is what kept me playing.

"This game has a lot of issues with its design, making it a frustrating experience. The graphics, while outdated, are not too bad and some parts even look good. Thor's health does not regenerate, meaning the best way to get health back is to die, which is a terrible design. Additionally, the terrain mini-games are so tight in timing that Thor will die repeatedly. Furthermore, some boss fights are impossible to beat as they come back with tougher attacks and have to be defeated in a few seconds. Other issues include running out of magic in levels where it is required and damage from terrain when walking along a path. Although there are some positives, such as some battles being fun and the powers and upgrades being handled well, the bad design outweighs the good. It may appeal to younger audiences due to its 'comic cartoon' feel, but overall it is a very unsatisfactory game.",marvels avengers game design issues game good graphics outdated ok parts look good thor health doesnt regenerate best way get health back die terrible design terrain minigames tight timing thors gonna die repeatedly boss fights impossible beat come back tougher attacks defeat seconds run magic levels required damage terrain walking path good battles handled well powers upgrades bad design outweigh good game feel comic cartoon appeal younger audiences unsatisfying game

The game crashes often and only covers two of the three movies, making it shorter than the other games. If you're new to the Lego games, I'd suggest the Harry Potter series, Star Wars or the original Indiana Jones. After playing this game for a while, it's clear that it's not up to the usual Lego standards. Even after the patch on the Xbox 360, there are still a lot of bugs, like not getting gamer points after completing levels, and the missions for white bricks seem to be longer than necessary.",ive played every lego game theres still fun one wouldnt recommend anyone unless huge hobbit fan already played games game crashes often two three movies games shorter games new lego games play harry potter series star wars original indiana jones clear playing lego games long time game isnt usual lego standards even patch xbox 360 theres lot bugs like getting gamer points completing levels missions white bricks seem longer necessary

The difficulty is not much higher than Rune Factory 2 and may even be easier than Rune Factory: Frontier, as it does not have the Runey System. The item creation system is simplified and the NPCs are good, though they don't have much backstory or many lines. One disadvantage compared to Frontier, 3 and Tides of Destiny is that if the main character loses all of their Hit Points in a dungeon, they get a game over instead of being sent to the clinic or to bed at the main character's house. Interestingly, instead of saying game over, it says ""try again"" when the main character collapses in a dungeon. One thing that many people may ask is why no other human characters can help the main character in battle like in other RPGs.",rune factory 4 special im enjoying far main character quite mysterious difficulty isnt much higher rune factory 2 even easier rune factory frontier doesnt runey system item creation system simplified npcs good dont much backstory many lines 1

"I first played Doom and Doom 2 when they were released and I was hooked. Recently, I decided to play them again in anticipation of Doom 3. One thing I remember about the series was the great atmosphere the music set. However, when I played this particular version, the music had changed. I was only able to set the number of channels for the game music, sound effects, etc., but there was no way to select the appropriate sound card option. Instead, it came with a horrible, outdated sound that could not be associated with a sound card. Additionally, when I opened the box, all I saw were two disks in a plastic case. For the price of 16 dollars, I would at least expect to find some form of manual. Because of this, I cannot give this version the five stars it deserves for being a masterpiece of a 3D shooter.

"First Encounter Assault Recon, or FEAR, has an unfortunate acronym in its title and it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a first-person shooter or survival horror game, so it ended up failing at both. The story is not very original and the level design and enemies are repetitive. The controls are also very awkward and there isn't much action. Furthermore, it has one of the most disappointing endings ever seen in a game. While there are some horror elements, such as a few jump scares and supernatural moments which are reminiscent of The Suffering and The Ring, they only make up a small portion of the overall gameplay.

"I was so disappointed with this game after purchasing it for the full price of $60 that I have not bought a game on the day of its release since. It was released in January, and it's now September and I still remember the terrible impression it made. The content was extremely weak, and I was embarrassed for European game developers. The game was fun for the first three hours it took to beat the six or seven multiplayer levels, but then there was nothing else. There was no PvP, just glitches and spells that lagged the entire server. The spell creation system was the worst design I've ever seen in a video game, with players stacking element cards to make random magic. It was also too easy to level since there were only a few maps with enemies that died in one hit. I traded the game almost immediately on goozex.com, but I had already reached level 147. I wouldn't be surprised if no one is still playing this game online, so discussing the multiplayer components is pointless. After nine months, I've recovered enough from the shock of how bad this game was to buy a game on the day of its release again, and I pre-ordered RAGE. I suggest you save your money for RAGE or one of the other big releases this holiday season, and not spend even two dollars on a game made by Polish people.",full price 60 game bought day release since january september still remember terrible impression content extremely weak embarrassing european game developers game fun first three hours took beat six seven multiplayer levels nothing else pvp glitches spells lagged entire server spell creation system worst design ive ever seen video game players stacked element cards make random magic easy level since few maps enemies died one hit traded game almost immediately goozexcom already reached level 147 wouldnt surprised anyone still playing game online discussing multiplayer components pointless nine months recovered shock bad game buy game day release preordered rage save money rage big releases holiday season dont even spend 2 game polish people

"I have found the Halo series to be overhyped and somewhat dull in comparison to other online FPS's such as Counter-Strike, Quake, and Unreal. However, Halo 3 has changed my opinion - it is the best in the series and lives up to its hype. The online play is incredibly stable and easy to use, and the graphics and sound effects are pleasing. The game is also highly addictive and provides great entertainment in single player mode. The Limited Edition is well worth the extra $10 for the metal case, mini-hard cover book, and bonus disc. Just remember to purchase the Limited Edition in a retail store so you can check for scratched discs.

"This title certainly deserved five stars due to its great story, fabulous gameplay, and beautiful world.

"I was really impressed with Spiderman 2 on the PS2. The developers managed to improve on the elements that made the game so enjoyable and added a free roam system, similar to GTA. The graphics are detailed and look great. The gameplay is always enjoyable, even if you have to swing across New York City. The fighting moves have been improved and there are new enemies to face. Bruce Campbell will guide you through the fundamentals with a new button system. The only downside is that once you complete the game, you cannot start over and play through the missions again. I also had a few issues with some of the mission strands and the Arsenic Candy girls who I found to be quite unbelievable.

"I'm absolutely blown away by the sheer amount of content this game has to offer. It has 117 teams with their respective stadium replicas, and each team's fight songs included. I'm amazed that they were able to fit all of this onto one disk! I'm playing the CU Buffs right now, and I find myself singing their school song while I'm playing, just like I do when I'm watching them play in real life. I even noticed they added a popular band song too. The game play is fluid, and it's clear they've taken advantage of the Madden game engine. The playbooks are great and they've even mirrored the playbooks to the teams' real-life playbooks. The AI is good to great, and the running plays are spot on. I haven't even gotten to the Dynasty Mode yet, but I'm already having a blast playing through my season. If you're a college football fan, you need to get this game.

"I usually don't bother reading reviews for titles I've already played, but that was a lesson learned. I wasn't expecting this game to be a free roam game, but at least I hoped it would continue the fight for freedom against the EDF force/government. Guerrilla inspired me like no other game had before. Fighting an oppressive government and fighting for basic rights was like nothing else. I can only assume that the world government pressured the developers to change the game style, so that young people wouldn't question their authority. It's almost as if they wanted games filled with propaganda and hatred towards other nations, like Homefront and Call of Duty MW. It's almost like Hitler brainwashed the German people into thinking that Jews were the source of their suffering. As for the game itself, I was surprised to see that my TV was displaying it in 1080p, even though I was expecting it to be below 720p. The graphics were really bad, despite the fact that they advertised it as running in full 1080p. There were a few new weapons, a good soundtrack, and short loading times, but that's it. I wouldn't recommend this to Guerrilla fans, and anyone else who enjoys mindless shooting should look for something more visually appealing, like Killzone 3.",redfactionguerrilla game review lesson learned dont bother reading reviews titles already played wasnt expecting game free roam game least hoped would continue fight freedom edf forcegovernment guerrilla inspired like game fighting oppressive government fighting basic rights like assume world government pressured developers change game style young people wouldnt question authority almost like wanted games filled propaganda hatred towards nations like homefront call duty mw almost like hitler brainwashed german people thinking jews source suffering game surprised see tv displaying 1080p expecting 720p graphics really bad despite advertised running full 1080p new weapons good soundtrack short loading times thats recommend guerrilla fans anyone else enjoys mindless shooting look something visually appealing killzone 3
"What a tragedy. GTA3 is an incredible game, but I can't experience it. Rockstar did an extremely poor job in bringing this game to the PC, like they were making fun of us non-Sony gamers. It takes a miracle for someone to install this game and be able to play it without needing hours of technical support and screaming at their monitor. The technical support isn't available on weekends and it takes at least 72 hours to get a response from an email. I'm not willing to wait a week to be told that it's not compatible. Even though my Pentium 4 computer works great, it isn't enough. It works poorly (if at all) with an optical mouse, it doesn't display text, the graphics are terrible and choppy, and the blood stains are just red boxes on the ground. It's a shame. My advice is to listen to other reviews and avoid this unacceptable game. Get the PS2 version or a PC game that is actually playable.",whatashame gta3 amazing game cant play rockstar made incredibly poor port pc like mocking us nonsony gamers miracle someone able install game play without needing hours technical support screaming monitor technical support isnt available weekends takes least 72 hours response email im going wait week told isnt compatible pentium 4 computer works great isnt enough works poorly optical mouse doesnt display text graphics terrible choppy blood stains red boxes ground shame listen reviews avoid unacceptable game get ps2 version pc game actually playable

I will try out the total punch control to be fair, but I highly doubt I will like it so I'll probably return the game and get a refund.

"When Half-Life first came out in 1999, I was 11 and not very interested in video games. Then, in 2004, Half-Life 2 was released and I was intrigued after reading a PC Gamer review (98%) and seeing some screenshots. I went to GameStop to buy it, but the shopkeeper asked me if I had played Half-Life before. Since I was under 17, he said he couldn't sell me the M-rated game until I had bought, played, and beaten the original. I got Half-Life and was amazed by the graphics, which were on par with many of the games from the 2000s. The sound quality was also great, and I could hear the faintest of noises. The story was quite simple, but it kept me engaged. I played as Gordon Freeman, a researcher at Black Mesa Labs, and had to fight against aliens and government soldiers after an experiment went wrong. The gameplay was awesome and the weapons were great. The online play was amazing, especially with Counter-Strike. Despite the many amazing games that have come out since, Half-Life is still the best game I have ever played and, in my opinion, the best game ever.",half life 1999 im 11 dont care video games 2004 half life 2 comes pc gamer review 98 screenshots gamestop buy game shopkeeper asks played half life im 17 cant sell m rated game buy play beat half life half life amazing graphics 2000s sound quality hear faintest noises story simple keeps engaged play gordon freeman researcher black mesa labs fight aliens government soldiers experiment goes wrong gameplay awesome weapons great online play amazing counter strike comes half life best game ive ever played best game ever

There are a multitude of activities to partake in, such as stealth, shooting, archery, and melee combat. Additionally, there are plenty of collectibles to find, upgrades to make, and skills to acquire, giving the game a slight RPG element. The sound, music, voice acting, and graphics are all remarkable. Most importantly, the gameplay is enjoyable and the quicktime events and combat do not take away from the exploration and puzzle-solving aspects. I was hesitant to purchase this game, but after investing a considerable amount of time, I can confidently say it was worth every penny.

The multiplayer mode is similar to others in the series, with veteran players reaching high levels quickly. The zombie mode is interesting, but Left 4 Dead is better. The graphics and audio are not impressive, and the positional audio is terrible. Overall, the game is only moderately enjoyable, and it was not worth the release date pricing.

"This game is not a true Resident Evil installment, but rather a third-person action shooter. It follows the storyline of Resident Evil 4 only very loosely. The story is not very engaging and the areas are either repetitive or overly difficult. There are a few familiar faces, including Wesker, but overall this game does not live up to the Resident Evil series. Sheva's inclusion in the game is questionable, as she does not compare to characters like Jill from the older games.

"It is hard to review this game as I have only played it for a couple of days and all I have done is press X, walk around the house, and occasionally use the up and down arrows to select dialogue. The story and characters are great and there are some nice anime sequences on DVD. The sound and music is good, like an anime TV show, and the voice acting is appreciated. However, when I died during the second battle, I had saved but it was far back in terms of the story. The game did not let me start the battle over again, like most RPGs do. Even games like Baten Kaitos and old Sega Genesis games allow you to start over. I refuse to waste my time with a game that forces me to repeat the same scenes just to figure out the battle mechanics. Due to the poor save system and the long length of this game, I find it unplayable and cannot recommend it, especially when there are better RPGs on other systems like Baten Kaitos, Zelda, and even Sega Genesis and SNES games. Even as a JRPG, this game is a failure.",hard review game ive played couple days ive done press x walk around house occasionally use updown arrows select dialogue story characters great nice anime sequences dvd sound music good like anime tv show voice acting appreciated died second battle saved far back terms story game let start battle like rpg baten kaitos old sega genesis games start refuse waste time game forces repeat scenes figure battle mechanics poor save system long length game unplayable cannot recommend especially better rpgs systems baten kaitos zelda even sega genesis snes games even jrpg game failure

"The story of this game is great but the game play is not up to par. The programmer should be embarrassed of their work as the movement graphics are glitchy and the background sometimes disappears when Spyro moves, causing him to fall and lose a life.

"I purchased Sushi Go Round for my seven-year-old sister as a birthday present, along with Crafting Mama. Although my sister enjoys the game, she finds it a bit too hard for her level and the game does not keep her attention for long. The only unique feature of this game is that if you own a DSi, you can take pictures of your friends and family and make them come to your restaurant. My sister does not own a DSi, so this feature was not useful to her. Therefore, I would give this game a four-star review. It does not seem to be the best choice for young children, and I would suggest Crafting Mama as an alternative, as my sister and my eleven-year-old sister both enjoy it more than Sushi Go Round.",sushi go round game bought 7 yr old sister birthday along crafting mama sister likes game bit hard level doesnt keep attention long unique feature game take pictures friends family make come restaurant sister doesnt dsi feature useless would give game 4 star review doesnt seem best choice young children would suggest crafting mama alternative sister 11 yr old sister enjoys sushi go round

The lengthy gameplay ensures you won't be finished in just a few hours, and when you do finish, there are tons of challenges awaiting you.

"This game has a similar feel to Thief, with decent gameplay. However, the story plot is quite predictable. I have played it on both normal and tough levels, but neither one was particularly challenging, likely because I had a better understanding of what to expect the second time around. There were moments when I was hidden, but enemies still managed to find me, which was irritating. The ability to 'Blink' quickly from one spot to another was great, but the cursor was not always exact, resulting in some accidental deaths. Additionally, I don't understand why killing someone who is unaware of you is handled differently than killing someone who knows you're there. In the latter case, it takes multiple shots to bring them down. Additionally, there were a few moments of confusion, such as in one mission where Samuel the boatman says he can't pick you up until you take out the spotlights, even though it is daytime and the sun is shining brightly. Lastly, the lighthouse was not pointing out to sea, as is typical, but rather towards land. Despite these flaws, the game was mostly entertaining and enjoyable, though it still falls short of Thief.",dust poor mans thief gameplay decent story predictable played normal tough levels neither particularly challenging probably better equipped second time round moments hidden enemies find irritating blink great cursor exact accidental deaths dont understand killing someone unaware different killing someone knows latter takes multiple shots bring moments confusion one mission samuel boatman says pick spotlights daytime sun shining brightly lighthouse pointing sea typical land game mostly entertaining enjoyable falls short thief

Even new titles are still being released for the system, and some current titles support 480p resolution, meaning the platform is not likely to disappear anytime soon.

"This game is not likely to appeal to most guys, as it is a toned down action and horror game designed for girls. The idea of blending RPG and survival horror elements was an interesting concept, but it failed in execution. The battle and weapon upgrade systems had potential, but were plagued with problems such as fast, undodgeable enemies and slow spells, as well as annoying penalties and inconveniences. The pacing, story development, and level design were also poor, with too much time spent watching cutscenes and too little time playing. The difficulty of the game is also frustrating, with cheap, insta-kill attacks and monsters that infinitely respawn. The monster designs range from silly and lame to embarrassing, and the soundtrack consists of two songs that repeat. The camera angles are also bad.

"This game is truly amazing. It is both thrilling and enjoyable to play, and the production values are top-notch. I had never had the chance to play the original Gamecube version or the PS2 rerelease, so this was my first time playing and I was not disappointed. The controls do take a bit of getting used to, as the nunchuck controller is used for movement and the Wii-mote is used for aiming, firing, and menu functions. It was a bit strange pointing the controller at the screen to shoot, but I eventually got used to it. Additionally, the action sequences that require timed button presses are made to be more engaging, as they are replaced with a shake of the controller or a winding motion. The B-movie presentation is great and the music is excellent, especially towards the end. Unfortunately, the graphics are outdated and somewhat blurry, and this is especially noticeable when compared to the HD graphics of games like Resident Evil 5. Despite this, the gameplay is still good enough that you can overlook this issue. As this version includes all the extra features from the PS2 version, it is a great value for the price.
